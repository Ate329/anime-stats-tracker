    "synopsis": "Life back on the cruise following the Island Special Examination is anything but smooth sailing. Almost immediately after their return, the first-year students of Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School face yet another special exam, with both class and individual points on the line.\n\nIn addition to the complicated ruleset, more issues arise in the form of Kakeru Ryuuen and Kei Karuizawa. Angered by the previous test's outcome, Ryuuen is dead set on outdoing every class in the new challenge using any means necessary. Meanwhile, Karuizawa, a crucial pillar of Class D, is close to crumbling under the pressure of her past.\n\nThe stage is now set for Kiyotaka Ayanokouji to once again—using the full extent of his planning, foresight, and ruthless manipulation—steer Class D to victory as dangerously close enemy forces try to bring it down.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Kou Yamori is an average middle school student who struggles with grasping the complex concept of love. Because he sees little sense in surrendering to the norm, he soon stops going to school. Plagued with insomnia due to his idleness, Kou begins roaming the lonesome streets at night.\n\nOne night, Kou encounters a bizarre girl named Nazuna Nanakusa who believes that people stay awake during the night because they are dissatisfied with how they spent their day and cannot rest until they release their inhibitions. Nazuna offers to help Kou with his sleep issues and invites him over to her place, where she convinces him to share a futon with her. Feeling uncomfortable, Kou only pretends to doze off—which is when Nazuna suddenly bites his neck, revealing herself to be a vampire!\n\nWhile Kou thinks the bite will turn him into a vampire, the specifics of transforming are not that simple. In order to change, he must be bitten by someone he truly loves. Ready to let go of his dreary mortal life, Kou decides on a new goal: he will fall in love with Nazuna and become a vampire himself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, when Emperor Jircniv Rune Farlord El Nix arranges a meeting with the Theocracy's messengers at a colosseum, he is confronted by none other than Ainz himself.\n\nWith their secret gathering now out in the open, the emperor and his guests learn that Ainz has challenged the Warrior King, the empire's greatest fighter, to a duel.

    "synopsis": "The number of terrorist acts in Japan has never been lower, thanks to the efforts of a syndicate called Direct Attack (DA). The organization raises orphaned girls as killers to carry out assassinations under their \"Lycoris\" program. Takina Inoue is an exceptional Lycoris with a strong sense of purpose and a penchant for perfection. Unfortunately, a hostage situation tests her patience, and the resulting act of insubordination leads to her transfer out of DA. Not thrilled about losing the only place she belonged to, she reluctantly arrives at her new base of operations—LycoReco, a cafe in disguise.\n\nTakina's new partner, however, turns out to be quite different from what she imagined. Despite being the famed Lycoris prodigy, Chisato Nishikigi appears almost unconcerned with her duties. She drags Takina along on all kinds of odd jobs under the simple explanation of helping people in need. Takina is even more puzzled when Chisato takes down a group of armed assailants without killing any of them. Feeling like a fish out of water, Takina itches to get reinstated into DA—but Chisato is determined to prove to her that there is more to a life than just taking them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When he finally regains consciousness, Ojisan begins to ramble in a foreign tongue and reveals that he had been transported to a magical world called Gran Bahamal. Takafumi dismisses his uncle's claims as nonsense until an incantation makes a cup of water hover in the air. In a flash of brilliance, the pair creates a YouTube channel to showcase Ojisan's magical abilities.\n\nThe responsibility now falls on Takafumi's shoulders to acquaint Ojisan with everything that has transpired during his absence, including getting him up to speed with the internet, new technology, and surprisingly, the outcome of the '90s console war—the result of which was especially distressing for a hardcore SEGA fan. With Ojisan's wisdom from his other world experiences, they grow their YouTube channel and tackle online comments and trolls. The journey of this uncle-nephew duo promises to be anything but conventional.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But, as if by divine comedy, the two find themselves reunited as step-siblings.\n\nA rivalry begins to brew between the former couple, both unwilling to acknowledge the other as the older sibling. In an attempt to \"solve\" this issue, Mizuto and Yume agree upon a rule: whoever crosses the boundaries of siblinghood norms loses, and the winner will not only be called the older sibling, but also get to make a request. However, now that they live under the same roof, the lingering memories they share start to influence their actions—possibly rekindling the feelings that may not have been fully extinguished in the first place.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Bearing the mark of a deity's divine blessing, Falma is capable of performing a unique divine art, allowing him to create and reduce any substance with the knowledge of its chemical properties.\n\nAfter reading through some pharmacology books, Falma realizes that this world is operating on similar medical practices as in ancient times. He also learns that medicine is an exclusive privilege to the nobility, depriving commoners of proper medical care. Using the knowledge from his past life and the divine abilities granted to him, Falma resolves to make medicine available to those who need it—irrespective of class.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Ayumu decides not to confess to Urushi until he can beat her in a match of shogi fair and square.\n\nNaturally, this self-imposed hurdle is a formidable challenge for Ayumu to overcome, as Urushi is far more experienced at the game and sees through his every strategy. Nevertheless, this does not stop him from praising her looks, her skill, or even her smile, which, coupled with Ayumu's expressionless face and direct approach, makes Urushi constantly blush beet red. Learning more about shogi and the charming player sitting across from him, Ayumu inches toward making his confession with each exciting round they play together—even if it is one pawn at a time!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "College student Yuuhi Amamiya's monotonous life is turned upside down with the appearance of Sir Noi Crezant, a talking lizard claiming to be a knight of justice. Crezant elaborates that the world is in peril—threatened by the mage Animus who wishes to annihilate it with his Biscuit Hammer, an enormous structure suspended in Earth's orbit. As the newly appointed Lizard Knight, Yuuhi must fight alongside other Beast Knights to protect the princess and save the planet from destruction.\n\nUnimpressed by the prospect of risking his life, Yuuhi continues his day as usual—until a golem created by Animus suddenly confronts him. Yuuhi is instantly overpowered, but his neighbor, Princess Samidare Asahina, luckily rescues him. To his surprise, Samidare's intention starkly differs from Crezant's; instead of saving the world, she aims to destroy it with her own hands. Captivated by her firm ambition, Yuuhi resolves to become stronger and help Samidare realize her goal.\n\nAs the pair continues to fight against Animus' golems, Yuuhi finds himself gradually gaining an interest in life—but the chains of his past trauma may restrain him from progressing further.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Jashin-chan often finds herself getting violently beaten by Yurine after not only any failed murder attempt, but also when she is just causing mischief, destroying any hope of going back home to Hell.\n\nThe demon is also terrible with money and tends to gamble all of it away at pachinko. In one of these gambling sessions, she loses the three million yen she received from Hell Financing, putting her into a lifelong debt. To avoid repaying it altogether, Jashin-chan flees to Hokkaido to try and hide for the rest of her days, but her wish of having her debts forgotten may just be a pipe dream when someone comes knocking for the money.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Urged to rebuild the Shinsengumi by the local feudal lord, Katamori Matsudaira, Toudou decides to offer eight convicts the chance to redeem themselves: they must abandon their old names and become substitutes for the eight Shinsengumi captains. All accept but one, who ends up immediately executed by the former assassin Sakuya.\n\nHowever, Toudou has a hard time transforming the seven reformed criminals into loyal servants. Due to his lack of discipline, the impulsive and vengeful Ichibanboshi, whose family perished at the hands of the Masked Demons, threatens the success of Toudou's strategy. As Toudou pledges to protect the shogunate against imperialists and foreign invaders, other factions, such as Kogorou Katsura's group, start to put their plans in motion with only one goal in mind—to seize power at the dusk of the Edo period.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the persisting conflict affecting morale, Grace Maitland Steward, a retired witch who still serves in the army, presents a plan advocating the power of music as an invaluable support that can change the tides of war.\n\nUnfortunately, her proposal is written off, prompting Grace to find a way to prove the potential of her idea to her superiors. She enlists the help of Aila Paivikki Linnamaa and Eleonore Giovanna Gassion—two witches who have already seen some success as singers—to recruit other witches and form the League of Nations Air Force's Music Squadron.\n\nThe campaign manages to produce seven promising candidates. Among them, 14-year-old Virginia Robertson, despite having no military experience whatsoever, seems to possess an ability too significant to ignore.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With nine-time champion Germany vying to defend their title once more, and powerhouse nations—Switzerland, France, and the United States—determined to make things interesting, the road to victory is perilous. Although Japan is sitting at the bottom of the rankings, the addition of the nation's strongest middle school players has reinvigorated their chances at winning.\n\nCaptained by the ruthless Houou Byoudouin, Japan is ready to show the world what they are capable of. However, before the real competition starts, the teams will have a chance to prove their strength through exhibition matches. As luck would have it, Japan is slated to face off against defending champion Germany—a match they are likely to lose. To make matters worse, old allies have suddenly reappeared as sworn enemies. Before Team Japan crumbles under the pressure of the international stage, they must rise from the ashes and claim the title for themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, the entertainment industry is not all fun and games, as she fails her auditions one after another and struggles to sell her songs.\n\nFinding herself still standing at the start line, Hiyori pursues her only opportunity to take the next step forward—partaking in Extreme Hearts. The popular event is a Hyper Sports tournament where participants compete in various sports using ability-enhancing gear for a chance to make their big break. Despite being athletic, however, Hiyori's lack of familiarity with Hyper Sports poses a problem for her. Fortunately, she befriends girls experienced in different sports, and they join the tournament alongside Hiyori, hoping to see her rise to the top.\n\nNow playing under Team RISE, Hiyori and her teammates learn about the unspoken rule of Extreme Hearts—all competitors must be entertainers or aspire to be one. For the members of Team RISE, facing the competition head-on is an inspiring endeavor that paves the way to discovering newfound interests and everlasting friendships.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
