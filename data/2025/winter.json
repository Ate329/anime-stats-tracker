Mona's absolute confidence in her own charms, however, is shaken when she meets Medaka Kuroiwa, a recent transfer student to her highschool. Unlike all other classmates who constantly fawn over her, Medaka frowns every time they interact. Seeing his disinterest as something to be rectified, Mona pulls out all the stops in the hopes of winning Medaka over, only to be met with one stern face after another.\n\nTurns out, Medaka's indifference to Mona stems from his wish to one day become a monk, and hence must leave all worldly desires behind. As the unknowing Mona ramps up her attacks on Medaka, all her antics might lead her into falling for him instead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Even if her meddling creates more problems for the hospital and those around her, none can deny the brilliance that the young department head exhibits as she weaves a diagnosis together.

    "synopsis": "Unlike his twin brother, Yukio, Rin Okumura never wished to know about their parents and the circumstances surrounding his own birth. Yet the master of time, Mephisto Pheles, gives Rin a key that transports him 40 years into the past when his late mother, Yuri Frederick Egin, was merely a child. With Mephisto's guidance, Rin leaps through the years of Yuri's childhood and her adolescence as an exorcist-in-training.\n\nEarly on, Yuri meets Shirou Fujimoto, Rin and Yukio's adoptive father. As Rin follows Yuri and Shirou's lives, he witnesses firsthand the initial appearances of Satan, his true father, and the horrors unfolding at the True Cross Order's special Section 13. Yuri's unique connection to Satan eventually leads Rin to the truth behind the most horrific event in exorcist history and the day he and Yukio were born—the Blue Night.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Tsukasa Akeuraji always dreamed of becoming a competitive solo figure skater, but starting too late in life meant his ambitions never got off the ground. Now barely scraping by, he takes on an assistant coach job, resigned to a future far from the one he once imagined.\n\nBefore his first day, Tsukasa meets Inori Yuitsuka, a shy fifth grader sneaking into the rink to practice. Captivated by figure skating, but held back by her mother's overprotectiveness and her own self-doubt, Inori has never been encouraged to pursue her passion until she encounters Tsukasa. Beneath her personality lies great potential, waiting to be unlocked with the right guidance.\n\nMoved by Inori's determination to change and reminded of his own struggles, Tsukasa offers to coach and help her chase the dream she has been too afraid to voice. While the road ahead is long and filled with unfamiliar challenges and rival skaters, Inori dedicates herself to the art and strives to one day reach the Olympics and become a medalist. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In a twist of fate, however, he finds himself in the lowest parts of a dungeon, ironically reincarnated as a Behemoth, an S-class monster of unparalleled strength and one of the very creatures he had once sworn to protect humans from.\n\nBeginning as a juvenile, he deceptively resembles an ordinary orange cat. Despite his seemingly overpowered ability to absorb the skills of any creature he devours, his escape from the dungeon leaves him gravely wounded. Just in time, Aria, a D-rank adventurer, stumbles upon him, decides to nurse him back to health, and ultimately takes him in as her pet, naming him Tama.\n\nAcknowledging Aria as his master and with his knight's honor from his past life on the line, Tama vows to defend her from danger at all costs—even if it means squandering this second chance at life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Aspiring manga artist Mizuho Nishino has grown alongside her four childhood friends: Kizuki Hazawa, Shuugo Hoshikawa, Shin Kashiwagi, and Airu Izumi. But on Mizuho's 17th birthday, Kizuki suddenly asks to be her boyfriend. Having no previous experience with romance, Mizuho brushes it off easily, but Kizuki is genuine and intends to win her heart.\n\nKizuki no longer hides his affections, and Mizuho hesitates, worried about the consequences their potential relationship could have on their whole friend group. As Mizuho works through the confusion of youth, it seems that the other three boys have fallen for her as well—and she must find a way to sort her feelings out without shattering the close-knit group she holds dear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Inside, she meets Haruka Akane, who promptly introduces her to the sport. Much like her previous attempts at athletics, Minami has no natural talent for golf, but something about the rhythm of swinging the club captivates her.

Go, Aquarion!\" \n\nAt the end of repeated reincarnation, the mechanical heavenly wing Aquarion appears.\nThe boys and girls, burdened with their destinies, will come face to face with the truth of the universe as the mysterious organization Space Egg Society and the intentions of adults intersect...\n\nThis is a grand myth of love spun with one's own feelings and the survival of the universe at stake.\n\n(Source: Official Site, translated)",
