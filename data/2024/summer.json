    "synopsis": "With the help of producer Masaya Kaburagi, Aquamarine \"Aqua\" Hoshino and Kana Arima have landed the roles of Touki and Tsurugi in Lala Lai Theatrical Company's stage adaptation of the popular manga series Tokyo Blade. Co-starring with them is Aqua's girlfriend, Akane Kurokawa, who plays Touki's fiancée, Princess Saya. Due to the fanbase preferring Tsurugi as Touki's love interest, Saya has made fewer and fewer appearances in the manga, making it difficult for Akane to fully immerse herself in the role. Her struggles are compounded by differences between the play's script and the original work—differences that also frustrate Tokyo Blade's author, Abiko Samejima.\n\nAqua, however, is more concerned with his personal goals than he is with the play. He has only one objective in mind: to grow closer to director Toshirou Kindaichi and find out what he knows about Aqua's mother, Ai.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Alisa Mikhailovna \"Alya\" Kujou, the half-Russian and half-Japanese treasurer of the school's student council, is known for her intelligence, stunning looks, and rigid personality. Contrasting her near-flawless persona, Alya's unmotivated classmate Masachika Kuze slacks off during lessons and seems to show no interest in her.\n\nInitially irritated, Alya gradually becomes more intrigued by Masachika and starts expressing her affection for him in Russian. However, she is oblivious to his secret—he understands the language fluently! Due to a childhood friend who was temporarily staying in Japan, Masachika has been studying Russian in hopes of reuniting with her.\n\nAs the two spend more time together, the playful and eccentric relationship between them quickly deepens. In the meantime, both must learn to navigate their new growing feelings for one another.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In fear that these formidable enemies would return, the five most powerful mages, known as the Magia Vander, built a magical dome and a tower to contain them. Since then, the five strongest mages of every generation are tasked with monitoring the dome from the top of the Wizard's Tower.\n\nInspired by this story, childhood friends Will Serfort and Elfaria Albis Serfort promised each other that they would climb to the top of the Wizard's Tower. However, now a sixth-year student at Regarden Magic Academy, Will's future looks bleak. Although Elfaria managed to join the ranks of the Magia Vander five years prior thanks to her unparalleled magical power, Will has no magical abilities whatsoever, attracting the ire of teachers and students alike.\n\nHowever, blessed with an exceptional physique, Will is able to slay monsters in the labyrinth and prevail against skilled magicians with the only aid of his sword and a few magical items. Determined to climb the Wizard's Tower at all cost, Will is determined to not let anyone or anything prevent him from keeping the promise he made to Elfaria.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately for him, skills of this nature are considered useless due to their low success rate, and Touka is thus assigned the title of E-rank hero. Things take a further turn for the worse when Vicius, the goddess who summoned the class, reveals that the lowest-ranked hero will be disposed of so that they do not hinder those with greater talent.\n\nBanished to a notoriously dangerous area, Touka comes face-to-face with death after being cornered by a minotaur-like creature. In a desperate attempt to survive, he uses his supposedly worthless skill—only to quickly realize that it works almost every time.

The ensuing conflict will shape the face of the continent for centuries to come...but Noor doesn't have a clue about any of that! Having freshly arrived at the royal capital after over a decade of rigorous, isolated training at his mountain home, he's dead set on achieving his childhood dream of becoming an adventurer, even if the only skills he possesses are useless ones. Sure, he can \"Parry\" thousands of swords in the span of a single breath, but everybody knows you need more than that if you want to be an adventurer! Our hero's road to making his dream come true will be long(?) and arduous(?)—but if there's one thing Noor's not afraid of, it's some good ol' fashioned hard work!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

Instead of dedicating himself to rigorous training in swordsmanship or archery, Tokiyuki excels in the art of evasion, skillfully dodging his advisors and discovering perfect hiding spots. However, his peaceful existence is shattered when a sudden coup brutally wipes out his clan.\n\nOverwhelmed with guilt for being the sole survivor, Tokiyuki contemplates joining his family in death. However, his fate takes an abrupt turn when the enigmatic priest Yorishige Suwa suddenly shoves him onto a battlefield. Yorishige, who prophesies that Tokiyuki will one day become a great hero, leaves the boy with no choice but to navigate his way free of enemy soldiers. As Tokiyuki struggles to survive against these foes, he finds a new thrill in raising the stakes of his usual hide-and-seek games.\n\nWith a renewed sense of purpose and the promise of powerful allies from Yorishige, Tokiyuki vows to avenge his family—not through his capability to fight, but through his extraordinary talent for running away.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now a second-year high school student and the president of the Manga Research Club, Masamune spends a peaceful existence watching the adventures of the angel Liliel, his favorite character.\n\nIn the beginning of the academic year, Masamune’s life is turned upside down when he meets first-year student Ririsa Amano, a passionate cosplay practitioner. Despite Masamune's initial reluctance, the determined young woman manages to convince him to become her personal photographer for the production of a collection dedicated to their common favorite character: Liliel.\n\nAs Masamune enthusiastically discovers the world of cosplay and photo editing, he is unexpectedly reunited with his childhood friend Mikari Tachibana, who has become a model in the hope of impressing her beloved upperclassman. Realizing that modeling is not enough to intrigue the hopeless otaku, Mikari decides to join the club and become a cosplayer herself, all to finally have a chance at winning Masamune's heart. However, Masamune's love for fictional characters may not be capable of extending to those who impersonate them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In an age where Sid's existence has become but a legend of the past, Kai Sakura Vento is one of the many conscripts tasked with monitoring the pyramids in fear that these old foes would escape.\n\nOn a peaceful day while spending time with his friend Jeanne E. Anise, the world is suddenly \"overwritten,\" transporting Kai to an alternate reality where humanity has nearly been annihilated by the demons and forced into hiding. To make matters worse, his very existence has been erased from this world; all of his friends, including Jeanne, who leads the local resistance efforts in this world, have forgotten about him.\n\nTrying to investigate the remains of his former world, Kai encounters Rinne, an enigmatic young woman trapped in a pyramid. Mysteriously inheriting Sid's legendary sword Codeholder, Kai manages to free Rinne from her imprisonment. Determined to fix this reality, Kai joins forces with Rinne and Jeanne to free humanity from demonic rule. But if the valiant soldier wants to have a chance at returning to his original world, he will first have to uncover the cause behind the mysterious alteration of reality.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Much like the other students at her school, first-year student Saki Aoi finds herself captivated by the beauty of her senior on the school board, Makoto Hanaoka. While she worries that Hanaoka would be uncomfortable receiving a confession from another girl, Aoi musters up the courage to tell her anyway. However, Hanaoka's response surprises Aoi for a completely different reason—Hanaoka is actually a cross-dressing boy!\n\nFully expecting Aoi to be abhorred by this revelation, Hanaoka is shocked to find that she has no issues with it. Though Hanaoka rejects Aoi's request to go out with her—citing his identity and the fact that he has never fallen in love before—Aoi insists that she will become his first love. Taken aback by Aoi's determination, Hanaoka wonders if he can really fall in love with her if he cannot find it in him to truly love himself first.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Among the many people affected by the tragedy, Natsuki Ikaruga, a brilliant recent graduate who had lost a leg in a submarine accident, is now reduced to living a miserable life on a near-deserted island.\n\nAfter Natsuki encounters a mysterious woman named Catherine, he uncovers an advanced humanoid robot that belonged to his grandmother Nonko, a renowned climatologist. Atri, the salvaged robot with the appearance and demeanor of a young girl, reveals to Natsuki that Nonko has tasked her with an important mission, but she has forgotten what it was.\n\nAlthough Natsuki was initially planning to sell Atri, the opportunity to connect with his grandmother's research through Atri makes him rethink his decision. Natsuki once had to sacrifice his dream to partake in a prestigious scientific mission. But as he opens up to his fellow islanders, he discovers that he can still make a difference in a desolate world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To come out on top of this business competition, Hayato must use his wits, fortify his trust in the girls, and figure out how to entice customers to continue supporting Familia.\n\nTo further complicate matters, the girls slowly begin to develop feelings for Hayato, causing tensions within the group.

Awayuki reveals that she is nothing more than a severe alcoholic who spouts profanities nonstop, constantly viewing her fellow VTubers with lustful admiration.\n\nHowever, instead of being reprimanded by her agency, Awayuki receives praise: her unhinged, disorderly conduct was Live-On's actual expectation of her.

To make his daily life easier, he purchases a secondhand housekeeping robot named Mina, who quickly proves her worth. One day, after returning from work and having one too many beers, Takuma somewhat jokingly blurts out that she should become his wife! Much to his surprise, Mina takes his words seriously, and the two gradually begin living as if they are married.\n\nAs the days go by, Takuma and Mina grow closer and start doing more activities together, like going on a picnic and spending a day at the beach. However, much of society still considers human-robot relationships unusual.

    "synopsis": "Despite a rocky start to their relationship, second-year high school students Mao Tsuchiya and Hisashi Ootomo have managed to find a way to coexist in their dorm room for another year. The roommates swear to abide by three simple promises: Mao must refrain from outing Ootomo as gay and having a boyfriend; Ootomo, in turn, must not fall in love with Mao; and the two must respect each other's privacy when one of them \"needs time to himself.\" While these are simple asks, the school's film club's new project suddenly puts them at risk.\n\nThe club's short film for the year is a boys' love story between a class president and a delinquent—a role for which Ootomo is considered the perfect fit. As the principal photographer in charge of composing every scene, Mao oversees all of the intimate moments between the leads, and though he wishes he could deny it, his growing attraction to his roommate is affecting the movie's production. But as things start to intensify—both in the film and in his personal life—Mao is soon forced to confront these complex emotions head-on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The killings appear unrelated at first glance, but every crime scene has one thing in common: a card left behind, bearing the words \"True of Vamp\"—the name given to the legendary progenitor of all vampires.\n\nThe Vlad Agency, a secret intelligence operation, summons the renowned aristocrat Dali Delico to lead the task force investigating the murders. However, Dali refuses, choosing to focus on raising his children. His old colleagues—Gerhard Fra, Henrique Lorca, and Dino Classico—plead with him to balance his duty to the agency with child-rearing. He agrees on one condition: the other three men must also care for their children during the investigation.\n\nDali's estate therefore becomes a nursery and the base of operations for the four noble vampires. Meanwhile, a criminal organization Dali knows all too well lurks in the shadows with evil intentions that threaten to cause the collapse of the entire vampire society.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Gathering through sheer coincidence, the six girls now work together and cheer each other on to chase their unique dreams.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As the news of the downfall of dangaishu—the katawara-hunting monks led by Yazen—spreads across the country, rogue groups of katawara start to form, worsening the already-fragile relationship between them and humanity.\n\nHaving lost faith in his abilities, Shinsuke Hyoudou now spends his time heavily drinking in the company of Senya, a former enemy of his who controls one thousand katawara within his body. Senya indirectly causes the death of the father of Tsukiko, his newfound friend, after a surprise attack of a local god gone berserk.\n\nDespite the circumstances, Tsukiko holds no grudge against Senya and is determined to become Shinsuke's disciple no matter what. Although Shinsuke refuses to become Tsukiko's sword instructor, he reluctantly agrees to let her travel with him and Senya. While the unlikely trio heads towards their next destination, Tama Youko continues her journey to find the trail of Jinka, the nine-tailed fox who has the power to destroy the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
