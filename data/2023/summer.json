    "synopsis": "The year is 2006, and the halls of Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School echo with the endless bickering and intense debate between two inseparable best friends. Exuding unshakeable confidence, Satoru Gojou and Suguru Getou believe there is no challenge too great for young and powerful Special Grade sorcerers such as themselves. They are tasked with safely delivering a sensible girl named Riko Amanai to the entity whose existence is the very essence of the jujutsu world. However, the mission plunges them into an exhausting swirl of moral conflict that threatens to destroy the already feeble amity between sorcerers and ordinary humans.\n\nTwelve years later, students and sorcerers are the frontline defense against the rising number of high-level curses born from humans' negative emotions. As the entities grow in power, their self-awareness and ambition increase too. The curses unite for the common goal of eradicating humans and creating a world of only cursed energy users, led by a dangerous, ancient cursed spirit. To dispose of their greatest obstacle—the strongest sorcerer, Gojou—they orchestrate an attack at Shibuya Station on Halloween. Dividing into teams, the sorcerers enter the fight prepared to risk everything to protect the innocent and their own kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "A 20-year-old shut-in is suddenly transported from his apartment, only to appear in front of a goddess who offers him a second chance at life. Although she grants him overpowered magical abilities in this new world, when he awakes as the newborn Prince Reinhardt, his talents are only measured at Level 2. Thinking their child to be an abysmal failure, his royal parents abandon him in the woods. There, the prince, who names himself Haruto, encounters Flay, a Flame Fenrir who decides to devote her life in service to him. Haruto's relative, Gold Zenfis, meets them both in the woods and decides to adopt the child as his own.\n\nNine years pass with Haruto under the care of the Zenfis family. His mastery over his overpowered barrier magic increases by the day, though Haruto would rather not use it to help others. He practices his magic in secret, preferring to have his family believe that he is weak. However, his younger sister, Charlotte, discovers his strength, and with the assistance of Flay, Haruto protects her and the rest of the Zenfis family from harm. With a shifty plot stirring in the kingdom, Haruto only wishes to stay inside and watch anime, but it seems he will have to use his magic to keep the family that took him in safe.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the war over, its infamous hero Hitokiri Battousai disappeared into thin air, leaving only his legend behind.\n\nYears later, a seemingly plain wanderer named Kenshin Himura encounters Kaoru Kamiya, the owner of a struggling local dojo in Tokyo. Kaoru pursues a self-proclaimed Battousai who roams the streets, indiscriminately killing citizens and police officers. Furthermore, the warrior professes to use the Kamiya Kasshin-ryu—a sword style developed by Kaoru's father deeply rooted in the essence of life, not death.\n\nKenshin decides to help Kaoru take down the impostor and restore her father's dojo. Unbeknownst to all, Kenshin is none other than the real warrior whose name still terrifies the people. Although Kaoru eventually learns the truth, his oath to atone for his murderous history by bloodlessly protecting the weak moves her, and she welcomes Kenshin to stay at her dojo. However, Kenshin's ideals are soon challenged by ghosts of the past and enemies of the present.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But underneath the seemingly prudent advice lies a truth that corrupts it—sons of the Akagami lineage are infamous for being heinous playboys. Determined to clear the notoriety of his family name, Akemitsu keeps his distance from girls throughout his life, only to become a victim of his bloodline's instincts, as he falls in love at first sight.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to rid himself of these desires, Akemitsu travels to a nearby temple in hopes of receiving Buddhist training. However, chaos ensues when the girl he had fallen for greets him at the door. After the commotion settles, he discovers the temple is actually a nunnery from which his father had borrowed millions before fleeing. Now working at the nunnery to repay the outstanding debts, Akemitsu tries his best to compose himself and stay celibate while being surrounded by lovely girls of all kinds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In 2242, the remnants of humanity are forced to live in scattered bubble-like cities across devastated lands. Hiding from toxic rain and hostile lifeforms known as Enders, they survive thanks to a new source of energy from AO crystals. Those tasked with risking their lives to collect AO crystals are called drifters, piloting versatile bipedal tanks with the support of combat androids named magus.\n\nWhile exploring remote ruins with his exceptionally gifted drifter friend Tokio, prospective drifter Kanata uncovers Noir, a seemingly intact magus in stasis. Although she wakes up by herself, Noir has lost her memories and is of no help in Kanata's work. However, amid an Enders attack, Kanata discovers that Noir possesses remarkable combat abilities. The pair now embarks on a journey to not only shed light on Noir's past but also to uncover the location of Histoire—the mythical city harboring secrets of the world that Kanata has always dreamt of visiting.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Since then, Yukito Yanagi has lived with foster families on the mainland, but he has isolated himself from others following a disturbing incident. Due to the wishes of his late father, Makoto, Yukito is brought back to his birthplace on the day of his middle school graduation. There he meets Makoto's disciples and learns of the supernatural state of the region. Mysterious life forms known as Mitama inhabit the islands, but their potential to feed off humans' negative energy and turn into ferocious monsters called Ara-Mitama endangers the islanders' lives.\n\nYukito discovers that, like his father, he is a Ley Master—a special individual with abilities akin to magic, tasked with pacifying the Ara-Mitama. As he learns to overcome his trauma and control his powers, Yukito decides to follow in his father's footsteps and become a first-rate Ley Master to protect the peace of Ayaka.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

By day, Dr. Hikaru Sudou runs a medical clinic for Humanoids; by night, under the moniker of Moggadeet, he performs illegal procedures and gathers information about his lost mother.\n\nHikaru encounters patients with varying problems unique to this society: a Humanoid struggling with the question of whether she and the source of her backup data are the same person, a teenage Humanoid who cannot improve athletically, and even a robot teddy bear with memories of multiple owners. As the world's technology constantly evolves, newer and more complex questions surrounding humanity arise. With each new advance, it becomes more difficult to define what truly makes one human or Humanoid.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
