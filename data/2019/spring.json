    "synopsis": "Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the family has fallen upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.\n\nWhen he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Osamu Dazai, still a new recruit at the time, was tasked with investigating rumors related to a mysterious explosion that decimated part of the city years ago—and its connection to the alleged reappearance of the former boss.\n\nDue to circumstances out of his control, he is partnered with Chuuya Nakahara, the gifted yet impulsive leader of a rival clan known as the Sheep, to uncover the truth behind the case and shine a light on the myth of Arahabaki—the god of fire who might just lead Dazai to the case's solution.\n\nMeanwhile, in the present day, it is business as usual once again for the Armed Detective Agency. Their peaceful break will not last for long, however, as enemies old and new gather their strength and prepare for another face-off.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Preferring a quiet life however, he secludes himself deep in the rural woods, dedicating his time to raising an orphan that he saved. This orphan is Shin, a normal salaryman in modern-day Japan who was reincarnated into Merlin's world while still retaining his past memories. As the years pass, Shin displays unparalleled talent in both magic casting and martial arts, much to Merlin's constant amazement.\n\nOn his 15th birthday, however, it becomes apparent that Shin only developed his combat skills and nothing else, leaving him with blatant social awkwardness, a lack of common sense, and a middling sense of responsibility. As a result, Shin enrolls in the kingdom's Magic Academy to hone his skills and mature among other teenagers. However, living a normal life is impossible, as he is established as a local celebrity almost as soon as he arrives.\n\nAs Shin Wolford adjusts to his high school life in the capital, he makes new friends, learns about the world, and fights off the various forces of evil surrounding him and his city.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Rather than pay up, Robby blasts off into space and heads to Isekandar, a planet that supposedly brings happiness to anyone who visits. Seeing a chance for some much needed excitement, Hacchi tags along with Robby on this journey filled with alien encounters, giant robot battles, and all sorts of troublemaking—all the while avoiding Yang and his cronies who are desperately combing the universe to find them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He uses a fossil to create a data coin that is compatible with his special jet. This allows for him to travel back in time to the original animal (a T-Rex) the fossil was made of. While GG Bond is ecstatic to learn about dinosaurs in-person (as well as mine more accurate data for the data coin), he didn't quite realize the danger he'd be in. He successfully gets out of this sticky situation but there's still a lot more dinosaurs he needs to get information on.",
