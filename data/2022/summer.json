    "synopsis": "Life back on the cruise following the Island Special Examination is anything but smooth sailing. Almost immediately after their return, the first-year students of Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School face yet another special exam, with both class and individual points on the line.\n\nIn addition to the complicated ruleset, more issues arise in the form of Kakeru Ryuuen and Kei Karuizawa. Angered by the previous test's outcome, Ryuuen is dead set on outdoing every class in the new challenge using any means necessary. Meanwhile, Karuizawa, a crucial pillar of Class D, is close to crumbling under the pressure of her past.\n\nThe stage is now set for Kiyotaka Ayanokouji to once again—using the full extent of his planning, foresight, and ruthless manipulation—steer Class D to victory as dangerously close enemy forces try to bring it down.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Kou Yamori is an average middle school student who struggles with grasping the complex concept of love. Because he sees little sense in surrendering to the norm, he soon stops going to school. Plagued with insomnia due to his idleness, Kou begins roaming the lonesome streets at night.\n\nOne night, Kou encounters a bizarre girl named Nazuna Nanakusa who believes that people stay awake during the night because they are dissatisfied with how they spent their day and cannot rest until they release their inhibitions. Nazuna offers to help Kou with his sleep issues and invites him over to her place, where she convinces him to share a futon with her. Feeling uncomfortable, Kou only pretends to doze off—which is when Nazuna suddenly bites his neck, revealing herself to be a vampire!\n\nWhile Kou thinks the bite will turn him into a vampire, the specifics of transforming are not that simple. In order to change, he must be bitten by someone he truly loves. Ready to let go of his dreary mortal life, Kou decides on a new goal: he will fall in love with Nazuna and become a vampire himself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Once a prosperous city known for its trade, it now faces a crisis due to its caution—or even fear—of its king, Ainz Ooal Gown. To make amends, Ainz sends Albedo to the city as a diplomatic envoy.\n\nMeanwhile, the cardinals of the Slane Theocracy discuss how to retaliate against Ainz after his attack crippled the Re-Estize Kingdom's army, plotting for the Baharuth Empire to take over the Sorcerer Kingdom. However, when Emperor Jircniv Rune Farlord El Nix arranges a meeting with the Theocracy's messengers at a colosseum, he is confronted by none other than Ainz himself.\n\nWith their secret gathering now out in the open, the emperor and his guests learn that Ainz has challenged the Warrior King, the empire's greatest fighter, to a duel. With Ainz's motivations beyond his comprehension, Jircniv can do nothing but watch as humanity's future changes before his very eyes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The number of terrorist acts in Japan has never been lower, thanks to the efforts of a syndicate called Direct Attack (DA). The organization raises orphaned girls as killers to carry out assassinations under their \"Lycoris\" program. Takina Inoue is an exceptional Lycoris with a strong sense of purpose and a penchant for perfection. Unfortunately, a hostage situation tests her patience, and the resulting act of insubordination leads to her transfer out of DA. Not thrilled about losing the only place she belonged to, she reluctantly arrives at her new base of operations—LycoReco, a cafe in disguise.\n\nTakina's new partner, however, turns out to be quite different from what she imagined. Despite being the famed Lycoris prodigy, Chisato Nishikigi appears almost unconcerned with her duties. She drags Takina along on all kinds of odd jobs under the simple explanation of helping people in need. Takina is even more puzzled when Chisato takes down a group of armed assailants without killing any of them. Feeling like a fish out of water, Takina itches to get reinstated into DA—but Chisato is determined to prove to her that there is more to a life than just taking them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When he finally regains consciousness, Ojisan begins to ramble in a foreign tongue and reveals that he had been transported to a magical world called Gran Bahamal. Takafumi dismisses his uncle's claims as nonsense until an incantation makes a cup of water hover in the air. In a flash of brilliance, the pair creates a YouTube channel to showcase Ojisan's magical abilities.\n\nThe responsibility now falls on Takafumi's shoulders to acquaint Ojisan with everything that has transpired during his absence, including getting him up to speed with the internet, new technology, and surprisingly, the outcome of the '90s console war—the result of which was especially distressing for a hardcore SEGA fan. With Ojisan's wisdom from his other world experiences, they grow their YouTube channel and tackle online comments and trolls. The journey of this uncle-nephew duo promises to be anything but conventional.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, their differences gradually grew, and they separated just after their middle school graduation. But, as if by divine comedy, the two find themselves reunited as step-siblings.\n\nA rivalry begins to brew between the former couple, both unwilling to acknowledge the other as the older sibling. In an attempt to \"solve\" this issue, Mizuto and Yume agree upon a rule: whoever crosses the boundaries of siblinghood norms loses, and the winner will not only be called the older sibling, but also get to make a request. However, now that they live under the same roof, the lingering memories they share start to influence their actions—possibly rekindling the feelings that may not have been fully extinguished in the first place.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He is most commonly known as \"The Demon of Sakuragi\"—a man who is not afraid to resort to violence if deemed necessary. After almost jeopardizing a peace treaty, his boss tasks him with the most difficult job he has ever had: taking care of seven-year-old Yaeka Sakuragi—the boss' precious daughter—so that Tooru understands what it means to be responsible for another life.\n\nAt first, the two do not seem to meet eye to eye, as Tooru has no clue on how to communicate with Yaeka, and the young girl is not used to expressing her emotions. However, as time goes on, they come to understand each other despite their differences. The fearsome right-hand man of a yakuza boss and the child he must protect are about to learn that family is not always bound by blood.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His sole motive is falling in love at first sight with Urushi Yaotome—the club's president and only member—and will do anything to get closer to her. However, Ayumu decides not to confess to Urushi until he can beat her in a match of shogi fair and square.\n\nNaturally, this self-imposed hurdle is a formidable challenge for Ayumu to overcome, as Urushi is far more experienced at the game and sees through his every strategy. Nevertheless, this does not stop him from praising her looks, her skill, or even her smile, which, coupled with Ayumu's expressionless face and direct approach, makes Urushi constantly blush beet red. Learning more about shogi and the charming player sitting across from him, Ayumu inches toward making his confession with each exciting round they play together—even if it is one pawn at a time!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Sadly, being too young, she can only watch as her elder sister, Yang Xiao Long, sets off for the academy alone. But everything changes when Ruby fights off a group of armed robbers, and the news of her skillful exploit reaches Beacon's headmaster, Professor Ozpin.\n\nRuby is over the moon when she receives an invitation to join the academy alongside her sister.

At the same time, lonesome rogue Blake Belladonna abandons her vigilante group in hopes of finding a better life at the academy. When their paths converge, the meeting between the four girls is anything but friendly. With vastly different personalities and beliefs, they often end up clashing.

As the newly appointed Lizard Knight, Yuuhi must fight alongside other Beast Knights to protect the princess and save the planet from destruction.\n\nUnimpressed by the prospect of risking his life, Yuuhi continues his day as usual—until a golem created by Animus suddenly confronts him. Yuuhi is instantly overpowered, but his neighbor, Princess Samidare Asahina, luckily rescues him. To his surprise, Samidare's intention starkly differs from Crezant's; instead of saving the world, she aims to destroy it with her own hands. Captivated by her firm ambition, Yuuhi resolves to become stronger and help Samidare realize her goal.\n\nAs the pair continues to fight against Animus' golems, Yuuhi finds himself gradually gaining an interest in life—but the chains of his past trauma may restrain him from progressing further.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Determined to learn more about his own past, Kojirou—alongside his Kanemaki clansmen—decides to participate in Uesugi's punitive expedition against the demon lord of Awaji Island: Yamata no Orochi, an eight-headed dragon that threatens to engulf the entire region.\n\nHowever, upon joining Uesugi's military alliance, Musashi faces the harsh reality of fighting against powerful demons. Humiliated by his lack of power and inability to work in groups, he has to learn how to cooperate with his newfound allies. Meanwhile, the Obsidian Eight—a group pursuing the Obsidian Goddess that dwells within Musashi's body—resumes its hunt for Musashi, and plans to thwart the ongoing island operation. As the situation grows chaotic, Musashi and his friends must foil the machinations of the various factions conspiring to seize the Obsidian Goddess.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When Ichigo learns that Aoyama is passionate about the environment, she seizes the chance to ask him out thanks to some tickets to an exhibition about endangered animals.\n\nDuring their date, Ichigo is struck by a mysterious light and faints. Waking up to the sight of Aoyama, she remains unharmed—but they both must escape from a giant rat-like creature after it injures Aoyama. To save her crush, Ichigo awakens her powers and transforms into a heroine with the skills of a cat.\n\nAfter she defeats the monster, researchers Ryou Shirogane and Keiichiro Akasaka explain that Ichigo was chosen to become a part of the Mew Project: a group of five magical girls whose DNA has been infused with those of certain endangered species.

One of her options is to kill the one who summoned her, which is much easier said than done. Jashin-chan often finds herself getting violently beaten by Yurine after not only any failed murder attempt, but also when she is just causing mischief, destroying any hope of going back home to Hell.\n\nThe demon is also terrible with money and tends to gamble all of it away at pachinko. In one of these gambling sessions, she loses the three million yen she received from Hell Financing, putting her into a lifelong debt. To avoid repaying it altogether, Jashin-chan flees to Hokkaido to try and hide for the rest of her days, but her wish of having her debts forgotten may just be a pipe dream when someone comes knocking for the money.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Urged to rebuild the Shinsengumi by the local feudal lord, Katamori Matsudaira, Toudou decides to offer eight convicts the chance to redeem themselves: they must abandon their old names and become substitutes for the eight Shinsengumi captains. All accept but one, who ends up immediately executed by the former assassin Sakuya.\n\nHowever, Toudou has a hard time transforming the seven reformed criminals into loyal servants. Due to his lack of discipline, the impulsive and vengeful Ichibanboshi, whose family perished at the hands of the Masked Demons, threatens the success of Toudou's strategy. As Toudou pledges to protect the shogunate against imperialists and foreign invaders, other factions, such as Kogorou Katsura's group, start to put their plans in motion with only one goal in mind—to seize power at the dusk of the Edo period.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Haru Nabatame, Rio Seibu, and Kyouka Tamaki's idol unit, TiNgS, is on the verge of disbandment. However, if they can fill all two thousand seats in their upcoming anniversary concert, their idol careers will live to see another day. This quota is seemingly impossible for a group like them, especially when the most people they have had at a show is 37. Fortunately, they are placed under a new talented manager—Naoki Hinase.\n\nWhile initially reluctant due to past experiences, Naoki takes charge of TiNgS after sensing Haru's genuine passion for idols with his own remarkable ability to see the shine of someone who is lying. Despite the challenges she faces in this ambitious endeavor, Haru wants everyone in the world to love idols, even willing to become the shining guidepost—shine post—to accomplish her dream.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Yuuya's apathetic attitude toward the fans and inability to take his job seriously causes his manager to give him an ultimatum: unless he starts putting in more effort, he will be fired.\n\nBackstage, Yuuya meets Asahi Mogami, an idol dressed in a colorful costume. Asahi would have had a bright future ahead of her—had she not died a year prior. Even as a ghost, Asahi wants nothing more than to perform for fans again. When she finds out that Yuuya does not hold the same passion for the idol life that she once did, she is overcome by a fit of rage and demands that he let her take his place. In a strange twist, Yuuya wakes up to find that Asahi has possessed him and can do what he is too lazy to do himself.\n\nWith Asahi performing for him, Yuuya thinks he has a ticket to an easy idol life. However, Asahi has other plans. Though she is no longer alive, she wishes for Yuuya to find the ambition that she still has. Together, she wants them to become the best idol the world has ever seen. But can an unmotivated man like Yuuya ever care about anything besides money?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She enlists the help of Aila Paivikki Linnamaa and Eleonore Giovanna Gassion—two witches who have already seen some success as singers—to recruit other witches and form the League of Nations Air Force's Music Squadron.\n\nThe campaign manages to produce seven promising candidates. Among them, 14-year-old Virginia Robertson, despite having no military experience whatsoever, seems to possess an ability too significant to ignore.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With nine-time champion Germany vying to defend their title once more, and powerhouse nations—Switzerland, France, and the United States—determined to make things interesting, the road to victory is perilous. Although Japan is sitting at the bottom of the rankings, the addition of the nation's strongest middle school players has reinvigorated their chances at winning.\n\nCaptained by the ruthless Houou Byoudouin, Japan is ready to show the world what they are capable of. However, before the real competition starts, the teams will have a chance to prove their strength through exhibition matches. As luck would have it, Japan is slated to face off against defending champion Germany—a match they are likely to lose. To make matters worse, old allies have suddenly reappeared as sworn enemies. Before Team Japan crumbles under the pressure of the international stage, they must rise from the ashes and claim the title for themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Hiyori Hayama is an aspiring singer who moved to Tokyo to make her debut. She has always loved singing and hopes to stand on stage like her favorite artist. Unfortunately, the entertainment industry is not all fun and games, as she fails her auditions one after another and struggles to sell her songs.\n\nFinding herself still standing at the start line, Hiyori pursues her only opportunity to take the next step forward—partaking in Extreme Hearts. The popular event is a Hyper Sports tournament where participants compete in various sports using ability-enhancing gear for a chance to make their big break. Despite being athletic, however, Hiyori's lack of familiarity with Hyper Sports poses a problem for her. Fortunately, she befriends girls experienced in different sports, and they join the tournament alongside Hiyori, hoping to see her rise to the top.\n\nNow playing under Team RISE, Hiyori and her teammates learn about the unspoken rule of Extreme Hearts—all competitors must be entertainers or aspire to be one. For the members of Team RISE, facing the competition head-on is an inspiring endeavor that paves the way to discovering newfound interests and everlasting friendships.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The sisters think nothing of this until the critters create a portal that summons an envoy from Hell.\n\nJabberwock the Eighth, a horned and fanged man covered in fur, has come to unleash a living hell on earth under orders from his boss. However, when living in the human realm proves to be challenging, the Onigami sisters allow him to stay with them.

Called Jigoku-san by the Onigami sisters, this messenger from Hell has a lot of work cut out for him if he wants to take over the world. But before that, he will have to survive the everyday hells of human life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
