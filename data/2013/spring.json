    "synopsis": "Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, while embarking on this brutal quest to take over the continent, his efforts are foiled by the hero Emilia, forcing Satan to make his swift retreat through a dimensional portal only to land in the human world.

Since then, these quakes have been plaguing the world intermittently, albeit on a lighter scale.\n\nShidou Itsuka is a seemingly average high school student who lives with his younger sister, Kotori. When an imminent spatial quake threatens the safety of Tengu City, he rushes to save her, only to be caught in the resulting eruption. He discovers a mysterious girl at its source, who is revealed to be a \"Spirit,\" an otherworldly entity whose appearance triggers a spatial quake. Soon after, he becomes embroiled in a skirmish between the girl and the Anti-Spirit Team, a ruthless strike force with the goal of annihilating Spirits.\n\nHowever, there is a third party that  believes in saving the spirits: \"Ratatoskr,\" which surprisingly is commanded by Shidou's little sister!  Kotori forcibly recruits Shidou after the clash, presenting to him an alternative method of dealing with the danger posed by the Spirits—make them fall in love with him. Now, the fate of the world rests on his dating prowess, as he seeks out Spirits in order to charm them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In the 71st year of the True Era, humans have successfully expanded into space and have started living in independent galactic colonies. The world itself is split between two major nations: the Atlantic Rim United States (ARUS) and the Dorssia Military Pact Federation (Dorssia)—superpowers that wage war against each other on Earth and far into outer space. In this war-torn era, a third faction comprised of Japan and Islands of the Oceanian Republic (JIOR), reside peacefully and prosper economically, maintaining neutrality between themselves and their militant neighbors.\n\nKakumeiki Valvrave commences in an outer space JIOR colony, where 17-year-old Haruto Tokishima's peaceful life is turned upside down as a sudden Dorssian fleet breaches the neutral colony. Their objective is to seize the Valvraves: powerful, but rumored mechanized weapons hidden deep within Haruto's school, Sakimori Academy. In the ensuing chaos, Haruto stumbles upon one of the targeted Valvraves. With his friends' lives in peril, Haruto enters the mecha and seals a contract for its power in exchange for his humanity. With the aid of L-elf—an enigmatic Dorssian agent and gifted strategist—Haruto and the Valvrave initiate a revolution to liberate the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, he finds not a ghost, but a beautiful girl with long flowing hair named Iwai Mushanokouji, the \"Hair Queen,\" whose hair cannot be cut due to a family curse.\n\nIwai explains that there is a death game surrounding her, and that if she is killed by a cursed object, aptly named a \"Killing Good,\" the wielder gets their wish granted. After protecting Iwai from \"Authors\"—Killing Goods users—he learns there is in fact a Killing Good passed down in his own family: a pair of scissors used by his ancestor to commit murders. Naming the scissors \"The Severing Crime Edge,\" he finds that he is able to cut Iwai's cursed hair with them, setting her free to live a normal life. However, many Authors seek to kill the Hair Queen, and Kiri will have to protect her in this lethal game of fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Every day might be new and exciting, but all Takurou really wants is to fish in peace!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
