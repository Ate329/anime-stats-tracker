    "synopsis": "After Marin Kitagawa introduced Wakana Gojou to the world of cosplay, he has been creating her outfits with ease. Even so, he still has a lot to learn, and every new lesson seems to strengthen his love for sewing and for the hina dolls his grandfather taught him to make.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitagawa finds it harder and harder to hide her feelings for Gojou. Friends and strangers alike constantly mistake them for a couple, much to Gojou's embarrassment. After all, in his eyes, their worlds are far too different for anyone to think they could be romantically linked. However, as Gojou spends more time with Kitagawa and realizes that his passions are not ridiculed by other people, a relationship between the two no longer seems so far-fetched.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With its prestigious history, Kikyo is attended by noble young ladies from distinguished families, while Chidori is infamously full of simple-minded delinquents.

One day, while helping out at his family's patisserie, he meets a customer who, after a brief moment, runs away from him. The next day, the customer returns to apologize to Rintarou, introducing herself as the cheerful Kaoruko Waguri.\n\nAfter spending time with Kaoruko, Rintarou appreciates that she does not judge him based on his appearance and looks forward to when they will meet again. However, when Rintarou discovers Kaoruko attends Kikyo, their relationship will challenge the social expectations and dynamics around them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite the constant warnings from his adoptive father Regto, Rudo spends his days searching for reusable materials that would otherwise be sent to the giant disposal area known as the Pit. Due to its vastness, the Pit doubles as a means of criminal punishment; those dropped in are never to return again.\n\nWhen Regto is murdered by a mysterious assailant, Rudo is falsely accused of the crime and thrown into the Pit. To his surprise, he awakens in a trash-filled area inhabited by enormous monsters formed from the junk. As the toxic air and Trash Beasts push Rudo to the brink of death, he is saved by Enjin, one of the Cleaners who wield weapons known as Vital Instruments to fight the monstrosities. Having gained his own Vital Instrument, Rudo soon joins the Cleaners in the hopes of finding a way to escape the Pit and avenge his father.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kafka is the first kaijuu to side with humans, and after careful consideration, he is eventually transferred to the Defense Force's First Division in the hope of adding his power to the strongest division, capable of handling any threat. However, some people are still doubtful about Kafka, and he must prove his worth in the next mission.\n\nKafka and the First Division are soon dispatched when a massive horde of ant-like kaijuu begins wreaking havoc. Thanks to the combined strength of Kafka's friend Kikoru Shinomiya and their captain, Gen Narumi, the mission seems to progress as it should. However, when Kafka fails to transform into his kaijuu form, the dreadful Kaijuu No. 9 joins the battle with only one goal—to eliminate him and steal his power. Although the situation is looking grim, Kafka must overcome his most difficult trial yet with the others if he wants to keep pursuing his dream: fighting side by side with his childhood friend and Third Division captain, Mina Ashiro.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Certain that it is not the Hikaru he knows who came back, Yoshiki finally asks Hikaru about it. Suddenly, \"Hikaru\" reveals his true monstrous form and begs Yoshiki to keep it a secret, as he does not want to kill him.\n\nDespite his paranormal nature, \"Hikaru\" seems almost innocent, full of childlike wonder and eager to experience the summer heat, the countryside, and all kinds of other things in a human body for the first time. And for Yoshiki, it matters little if \"Hikaru\" is a fake relying on stolen memories—as long as he never leaves again. As Yoshiki desperately clings to \"Hikaru\" in his intense grief, it becomes increasingly clear that something dangerous and supernatural may have descended from the mountains into their village.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A lone man named Momotarou opposed these gruesome, near-invincible monsters, but the war against them was just beginning.\n\nThousands of years in the future, temperamental gun enthusiast Shiki Ichinose leads a carefree life. However, after his expulsion from school, everything changes. Shiki is suddenly attacked by a man and is rescued by his adoptive father, Tsuyoshi. As the two flee, Tsuyoshi reveals that Shiki is actually a descendant of the Oni, while both he and their pursuer are from the Momotarou lineage.\n\nThe two Momotarou soon clash in a fierce battle, and Tsuyoshi sacrifices himself to protect Shiki. Devastated, Shiki awakens to his Oni blood that grants him immense strength at the cost of going berserk. Although the enemy escapes, Naito Mudano, an Oni teacher at Rasetsu Academy, takes an interest in Shiki. Under Mudano's guidance, Shiki must learn to control the Oni blood—if he ever hopes to avenge his father.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After mastering demonic magic, he sets his sights on the Church to learn the secrets of divine magic that will bring him one step closer to completing his arsenal. However, due to his fondness for unholy magic, he draws the scrutiny of divine beings who see him as little more than a demonic spawn.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Takuto Ira spent his short life confined to a hospital bed, with the civilization-building game Eternal Nations as his only form of entertainment. His favorite faction within the game—Mynoghra—was infamously complex to navigate and skewed toward evil; moreover, he insisted on playing at the highest difficulty.\n\nAfter his untimely death, Takuto awakens in a world uncannily reminiscent of Eternal Nations. He is reincarnated as the King of Ruin, sovereign of Mynoghra itself. At his side stands Odei no Atou, the default hero unit of his chosen nation. Remembering every battle they fought together, she pledges unwavering loyalty to Takuto once more.\n\nAs Takuto begins to build Mynoghra from scratch in this new world, his early-game strategy remains unchanged: lie low, avoid war, and ensure survival at all costs—ironic for an evil ruler meant to conquer the world. When he offers refuge to persecuted Dark Elves fleeing destruction, a fledgling empire born of a darkness the world has yet to understand begins to take shape.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, they have drifted apart from each other due to their overwhelming dedication to their fields, effectively turning them into strangers living under the same roof.\n\nEnter Yuu Ayase, the son of the late Subaru Ayase, a legendary actress who graduated from Saika. Unlike his mother, Yuu lacks any extraordinary talent whatsoever, much to the disappointment of those who knew her. Still, he transfers to her alma mater with one quiet promise in his heart: to fulfill her final wish that he build a true and happy family.\n\nIt just so happens that the Mikadono patriarch is also Subaru's longtime friend and benefactor, and he offers Yuu both a place to stay and a fresh start. Thrust into the lives of three estranged sisters who act cold toward him, Yuu may not be a genius himself, but the clumsy sincerity he brings might be what they all need to start anew.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to its high price, she can only dream of owning one—until her mother tells her about a mountainous area where Ruri's grandfather used to discover numerous minerals. As she makes her way to the location in the hope of finding materials to make her own accessories, Ruri meets Nagi Arato, a graduate student, who gladly shows her the way.\n\nSoon, Ruri is left smitten when they arrive at an enormous quartz formation. More motivated than ever, she convinces Nagi to teach her more about mineralogy. With each new discovery and Nagi's lessons deepening her love, Ruri learns that there is more to minerals than just their price.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Believing Anastasia to be the one he fell for, Kyros proposes via letter. But Anastasia tragically dies on her way to marry him.

Adding to his woes, he does not even have enough money for the train fare back, stranding him. With help from a former professor, Allen secures an unusual job offer: to be the private tutor of the daughter of Duke Howard, one of the kingdom's most powerful nobles.\n\nThe girl, Tina, however, has one critical flaw—she is completely unable to use magic. Though her academic prowess is nothing short of prodigious, intellect alone is not enough for the fast-approaching entrance exams to the prestigious Royal Academy. Moreover, countless magic instructors have tried to solve her problem and gave up in the process. To help Tina overcome her limitations, Allen must dig deeper into the roots of her magical inability, and, in doing so, uncover far more than he ever signed up for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With its various suggestive attractions, the Seirantou Health Organization (SHO) entices visitors while providing regular medical checks and contraceptive pills to ensure carefree enjoyment.\n\nHowever, for high school student Junnosuke Tachibana, the island is far from ideal. Having recently moved there with his younger sister, Asane, he cannot stand the empty, loveless sexual acts. To make matters worse, Junnosuke's abstinence attracts unwanted attention—and those who defy the law face punishment.\n\nJunnosuke soon crosses paths with Nanase Katagiri, a notorious island seductress. Surprisingly, instead of forcing herself on him, she helps him flee from the SHO. Together, they discover a secret group that exists for a singular goal: to destroy the SHO. Now equipped with a way to resist the unjust rules, Junnosuke and other kindred spirits set out to crush the Pervert Law.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "At the age of 15, Hana Tabata has already made peace with the idea of never experiencing an unforgettable high school romance. Although she likes shoujo manga, flowers, and anything cute, Tabata considers herself a mere background character; she is a little bit chubby, with a round face, glasses, and freckles—all things that would make her conventionally unattractive. But when Tabata accidentally befriends Yousuke Ueno, a warm and charming classmate, things start to change. While she grapples with conflicting feelings about her unexpected new relationship with Ueno, Tabata has yet to realize that the love story she has been dreaming of has already begun.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From afar, she reveres her upperclassman and the school's Public Decency Officer, Atori Mizutori, and desperately wants her attention. When she realizes that the best way to get Atori to notice her is to be a delinquent, she begins to dress differently: she dyes parts of her hair a bright red, wears clips on her ears to resemble piercings, and attaches jumbo erasers to her shoes to give them thicker soles.\n\nDespite Yuu's best efforts and even with the advice of her \"natural born delinquent\" friend Suzu Suzukaze, all of her plans to be a bad girl go awry. Still, Yuu manages to befriend Atori and pledges to spend as much time as possible together, not knowing there are others vying for Atori's attention. In the process, Yuu has also gained the attention of the school's self-proclaimed idol, Rura Ruriha, filling her once-invisible life with more attention than she may be able to handle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, selective breeding of cats results in an extraordinary individual who carries a strange virus. The outbreak—dubbed the Nyandemic—turns any human who makes contact with an infected feline into one themselves.\n\nKunagi, a man who has lost all of his memories, is forced to flee mid-shift from a cat cafe. With him are siblings who run the place, Gaku and Kaoru, and a customer named Tanishi. But Gaku confesses that he is already infected and pleads with Kunagi to protect his sister. After experiencing the danger firsthand, the remaining three begin searching for a way to survive the very animals they adore.\n\nDespite the government's best efforts to halt the feline hordes, the Nyandemic uncontrollably spreads. Human extinction seems more probable by the hour—but Kunagi, Kaoru, and Tanishi refuse to surrender their humanity without a fight!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But a motorcycle accident sends Takeru to Denji Heian-kyo—an alternate version of Japan's ancient capital with futuristic technology and the home of the girl from his dreams, Tsukiyima, who does not recognize him.\n\nHowever, a black mist soon descends upon the city, petrifying citizens and unleashing monsters called oni. Only the so-called onmyouji—sorcerers who wield mystical powers and pilot magical \"shikigami\" suits—can fight them. When the mist returns, Takeru discovers that he has strange transformation powers and can resist the oni. But he and Tsukimiya are ultimately killed, and Takeru awakens in Denji Heian-kyo once again, this time two weeks before the appearance of the mist. Swearing to protect Tsukimiya at all costs, Takeru vows to become an onmyouji and change the future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "When university students Kuriaki Magi and Yaeko Kirihara witness a man receive a fatal blow to the head, they can barely believe it when he flees the scene unscathed. Once they catch up to the victim, Momoyuki Mogura, they learn that he is immortal.\n\nWhile Magi and Yaeko initially presume Mogura is delusional, their opinion of him changes as they begin seeing apparitions. As Mogura explains, those are spirits of dead people that produce demon fire, a light that guides the spirits after death. Stripped of the right to carry the fire, Mogura has spent years collecting the products from spirits, hoping to one day enter the afterlife. With Magi and Yaeko now helping him find more spirits, the mysterious Mogura may finally achieve his peculiar dream.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Today, she is revered as the goddess Lushe, and a temple in her honor gathers individuals with similar powers to serve the kingdom as so-called saintesses.\n\nLua Restoatt is a saintess candidate, but her power is defective—she heals by transferring others' injuries to herself, which earned her the nickname \"Broken Saintess.\" This flawed ability nearly kills her when she rushes to save Garrett Vance, a knight captain she admires. But Lua's best friend, Arianne Trebias, takes the credit and becomes engaged to Garrett.\n\nCrushed by the betrayal, Lua vows never to heal again and prioritizes her secret second ability: inflicting others with the ailments she once absorbed. After witnessing this, Second Prince Sven Geed Crone approaches Lua and offers an alliance. Hungry for revenge, the once-timid Lua accepts Sven's proposal, ready to strike back at those who have wronged her and help the prince expose dark secrets of the temple.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The very next day, his classmate Miyako Kujou, who was cosplaying at the event, worries that she has been cursed as a result of the earthquake, but Niimi brushes her suspicions off.\n\nHowever, Niimi's mind changes when he discovers that various people have gained supernatural powers in the city—and that some have started using them for nefarious purposes. Fortunately, Niimi is not alone: he is joined by Miyako, his sister Sora, and a cold girl named Noa Yuuki, who have all awakened to their own abilities. If the group wants to keep their hometown safe, they must strive to prevent any future incidents while unraveling the mystery behind it all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She has been covering the hospital bills of her close friend and fellow streamer, Mayu Mayusaka, ever since she and other popular streamers mysteriously fell into a coma three months ago.\n\nDesperate for money, Miko agrees to participate in a top-secret beta test for a cutting-edge VR game. After clearing the first level, she and six other streamers come face-to-face with the Old Ones—ancient, evil gods who have returned to take over the Earth but are currently trapped inside the VR world. Miko becomes enraged when she discovers that one of the gods, Cthulhu, has taken the likeness of Mayu and is the one responsible for her condition.\n\nAlongside the others, Miko is now a part of the Old Ones' twisted game called the Cosmic Horror Show, where the elimination of all the players results in humanity's doom. However, knowing that the winner is granted a single wish, Miko sets out to beat the game and save Mayu.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With her namesake talent in singing, she attempts to join her school's light music club but repeatedly fails due to her extreme shyness and lack of confidence. Intimidated by the dazzling presence of the club's members, Uta fears to even submit her application.\n\nOne day, Uta receives an invitation from Airi Kojou, president of the a cappella club, to check out their club instead. Unlike the light music club, this group performs purely without instruments. Uta soon finds herself amazed by the way the members' voices resonate with one another—delicate yet cohesive, resembling a mille-feuille dessert's thousand layers. Moved, Uta takes a quiet step forward into creating a harmony where everyone shines together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When they finally manage to catch it, it turns out to be a talking Pallas's cat named Nuru!\n\nNuru has come from the distant future with a serious mission to inform them that the Earth is facing an impending threat of destruction. While he says he wants to protect the Earth, he says he's only come to warn them of the crisis, and that it's up to the five of them to decide whether or not they want to fight for the Earth...\n\nIsn't this just an attempt to dodge responsibility? The Defense Club members are suspicious. \"If either is fine with you, I'll do it! That's more fashionable!\" Unzen enthusiastically says. The five decide to fight with free will, and Nuru transforms them into the Haikara Romantic Troupe using feline science.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious trio called the Bankara New Elite Squad are scheming in the shadows. They are plotting to take over the Earth.\n\n(Source: Official site, translated and edited)",
