    "synopsis": "The next phase of the controversial Blue Lock project is underway with the candidate pool being dwindled down to just 35. Out of the remaining strikers, only a select few will be chosen to play in an upcoming exhibition game against the current U-20 Japanese soccer team. Playing in this match comes with a caveat: winning will grant the players the right to represent the nation as the new U-20 team, but losing will bring an end to Blue Lock in its entirety. Among the ones left in the running is Yoichi Isagi, who is coming to terms with his own abilities.\n\nTo further complicate matters, the six best players in the pool have already been named to the starting lineup and the remaining 29 will have to duke it out to claim a coveted spot. Each candidate must select a top six pairing to team up with for the selection to prove their competence. But if this mishmash of strikers wants to overthrow the current U-20 team, they will need to find a way to combine their playstyles effectively.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although Chinatsu seems unapproachable, Taiki gradually finds opportunities to get to know her little by little.\n\nUnbeknownst to Taiki, his tireless work ethic and admiration motivate Chinatsu to work harder and strive to achieve her greatest ambitions. When her family must suddenly move overseas for work, Chinatsu decides to remain in Japan and shoot for victory at the national level.

To this end, he publicly states his intention to study theology—the academic field held in highest regard in early 15th century Poland. However, an encounter with a mysterious man upends Rafal's life, sparking an illogical desire to instead pursue his passion for astronomy.\n\nRafal is determined to prove the beauty and rationality of heliocentrism—the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This belief is considered heretical by the powerful Church, which promotes geocentrism—the Sun revolving around the Earth—as the sole truth of the universe. Those whose beliefs do not align with the will of the Church suffer unfathomably gruesome consequences.\n\nIn pursuit of evidence for a heliocentric model of the universe, Rafal grapples with obtaining precise calculations and building empirical theories. His greatest challenge, however, lies in conducting this research discreetly—lest he wish to meet the same fate as other heretics.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "During their martial arts training expedition in China, Ranma Saotome and his father Genma suffered an accident, which in turn, afflicted them with a curse—whenever they are doused with cold water, Ranma transforms into a girl, while his father turns into a panda! Only hot water can reverse these changes, but any further contact with cold water opens the can of worms once more.\n\nUnfortunately, the trouble does not end there, as Ranma finds out about his betrothal to one of the daughters of Soun Tendou, his father's closest friend. During the families' first meeting, it is decided that Ranma is to be married to Akane, the youngest daughter, a decision that is met with vehement protests from both sides. The two are simply not compatible, yet they are forced to live under one roof. Ranma's status quo further adds to the chaos, leading him to a series of comedic situations and misunderstandings that, in the grand scheme of things, may just be what he needs to work with Akane.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To this end, 17-year-old Yoshino moves to Tokyo to live with the Miyama family and attend school with her new fiancé. Although Kirishima is all smiles and perfectly polite, there is something unsettling about his demeanor that Yoshino cannot put her finger on.\n\nYoshino's suspicions are soon confirmed: despite his manners, Kirishima is a masochistic maniac. He hurts people without batting an eye and also revels in being punished verbally and physically himself. What he wants most is a spoiled and arrogant fiancée who will ruin his life. When Yoshino does not quite meet his expectations, he reveals his true colors and openly insults her. However, instead of running away in fear, Yoshino decides to take revenge by making Kirishima fall in love with her and then ruthlessly breaking his heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The conflict came to an end when mortals' hero, Gram, slayed the Demon Lord Veltol Velvet Velsvolt. In 2099, the world looks a bit different. Alneath and technologically advanced Earth have fused in an event known as Fantasion. Immortals have been hunted down to near extinction, and technological implants called Familia allow mortals to use magic.\n\nAs the new world slowly recovers, Veltol's vassal Machina Solege resurrects him in Shinjuku, a techno-magical city constructed in the middle of devastated lands. However, Veltol's magic is severely weakened, and his former ally Marcus has betrayed him. To regain his fame and magical abilities, Veltol follows the advice of Takahashi—Machina's friend and a professional hacker—to start an unusual career: live streaming. His sharp tongue and comically poor gaming skills quickly secure him followers, but to dominate the world once again, Veltol must first uncover Shinjuku's secrets and thwart Marcus' vile plans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Jealous of his brother's power, Degesu works alongside Gomah to steal Earth's Dragon Balls and preemptively subdue any potential future enemies.

Joined by Kaioshin and Glorio—a mysterious but seemingly rebellious demon—Gokuu pursues Gomah to the Demon Realm in order to rescue Dende and restore his friends to their natural ages.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, an uncertain future looms over their treasured tranquility when their company plans to open a branch office in Alaska within one year and transfer an unmarried employee there.\n\nDuring a day off, Takuya and Rika accidentally meet and, despite never having spoken before, open up to each other about their relocation fears. Feeling encouraged by Takuya facing the same predicament, Rika suddenly proposes a daring solution—to pretend to be engaged for 365 days. Takuya accepts, but little do the two know that the path to marriage may, in many ways, change forever the very lifestyles they struggle to preserve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to his beliefs, he aims to become a doctor, spending most of his time studying to enter the prestigious Kyoto University.\n\nTo further his studies, Uryuu searches for a new place to take him in and get away from the noisy environment of the orphanage where he grew up. Chidori Amagami, head priest of the Amagami Shrine, allows him to stay at the Amagami residence. However, Uryuu has to live there with Chidori's three granddaughters—Yae, Yuna, and Asahi—who serve as shrine maidens. Moreover, Chidori has another condition for Uryuu: he has to marry one of the sisters to ensure the shrine's future and one day inherit it. But with Uryuu's goals and outlook naturally clashing against the sisters' beliefs, this already daunting ordeal seems outright impossible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Alma fuses with his jacket, introducing Hikaru to the world of mechanical arms: mysterious, sentient weapons that normally become a part of their users' bodies. Forced to flee for his life, Hikaru is eventually captured by Aki Murasame, a twin mechanical arms user working for ARMS, an organization that protects the machines against unethical treatment.\n\nThe Kagami Group, a nefarious organization that treats mechanical arms as mere tools, seeks to recover Alma. Hikaru is deemed a failure by ARMS for his lack of natural predisposition to be an mechanical arm wielder, so Aki is assigned to be his bodyguard. But Aki is defeated by Jun Kagami, who cruelly tears out her two mechanical limbs, condemning the girl to a slow death. Unwilling to abandon Aki to her grim fate, Hikaru miraculously awakens his power and neutralizes Kagami. Now a full member of ARMS, Hikaru is determined to unravel the truth about mechanical arms and protect his newfound friends and allies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
