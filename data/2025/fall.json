    "synopsis": "Despite occasional setbacks, Operation Strix has remained on track to extract sensitive information from the enigmatic politician Donovan Desmond. To this end, spy Loid Forger has managed to maintain his pretend family consisting of his telepathic daughter, Anya; assassin wife, Yor; and their clairvoyant dog, Bond. Still the only one aware of everyone's true identities, Anya tries to sustain the family's cohesion while working to befriend Donovan's son Damian, her Eden Academy classmate.\n\nHowever, Anya's efforts instead earn her another Tonitrus Bolt, bringing her closer to getting expelled and jeopardizing the operation's success. Hearing the news, Loid faints from shock. In his unconsciousness, he reminisces about his tragic past and his journey to becoming a spy. Realizing what Operation Strix means to him and the world, Loid finds renewed motivation. Although they each work toward their own covert goals, the Forgers continue to cherish their chaotic yet blissful family life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, to preserve her family's image, she suppresses her instincts and tolerates the abuse inflicted by her childish fiancé, Second Prince Kyle Von Pallistan. Only Kyle's brother, First Prince Julius, is aware that there is more to Scarlet than meets the eye, but she cares little about his growing interest.\n\nIn the middle of a ball, Kyle accuses Scarlet of harassing Terenezza Hopkins, a commoner that has taken his heart. Scarlet's engagement to Kyle is nullified, leaving her outraged that all of her efforts to endure thus far have amounted to nothing. Scarlet dons her studded leather gloves, once again becoming the \"Mad Dog Princess.\" Joined by Julius and werebeast Nanaka, Scarlet is ready to give filthy nobles a taste of their own medicine—one punch at a time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Luckily, that barely makes a dent in Saku's confidence. Outside niche internet forums, he is the reputable figure his schoolmates admire and a model student his teachers trust.\n\nAs his second year of high school commences, Saku reunites with his old friends and befriends new ones, all belonging to the school's social elite. However, the fun is cut short when Saku's homeroom teacher instructs him to convince his shut-in classmate, Kenta Yamazaki, to return to school. Wishing to wrap things up quickly, Saku visits Kenta's house the very next day. But the task proves more challenging than he expected when he discovers that Kenta is firmly and fully on the Saku hate train. If he wants to preserve his impeccable image, Saku must find a way to win over Kenta and bring him back to school. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

By teaching the people of the Marchalrayd lands to prepare such exotic ingredients, Melphiera hopes to help stave off famine. Unfortunately, her unique tastes and intimate knowledge of monsters have led to her social isolation: few nobles interact with her willingly, disdainfully calling her the \"Voracious Villainess.\"\n\nWhen a monster attack erupts at a royal banquet—where Melphiera has been sent to find a husband—Aristide Rogier du Galbraith, the younger brother of the crown prince, leaps to her aid. Due to his terrifying skill in slaying monsters, Aristide has earned the title of \"Blood-Man Duke.\" Charmed by Melphiera's fearlessness and intriguing culinary prowess, Aristide  soon declares his intent to propose.\n\nTogether, Melphiera and Aristide, high society's most eccentric couple, strive to see beyond the cruel rumors and encourage each other's fascination with monsters and the art of preparing them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She has the power to transform her surroundings by manipulating the elements of the periodic table. On top of that, Ellen also has a great amount of scientific knowledge due to being a scientist in her past life.\n\nDuring the war against a neighboring kingdom, Rovel Vankreift, the hero of the Kingdom of Tenbahl and eldest son of house Vankreift—as well as Ellen's father—was fatally injured. However, the spirit who fought by Rovel's side, Lady Origin, brought him to her realm to save him from the clutches of death. Lady Origin, who happens to be the Queen of the Spirit Realm as well as Ellen's eventual mother, is one of the most powerful spirits in existence, making little Ellen quite powerful in contrast to her innocent looks.\n\nBut even a family as happy as this one has its fair share of problems, as Ellen and her parents are forced to reconnect their old ties to the Vankreift household in order to defend their relatives' honor—all while hiding Ellen's dangerous existence from the public to preserve their undisturbed happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He is soon captivated by his classmate Kashiwada, a mysterious student who consistently wears a blank face. Oota conspires to break her placid demeanor through scares and mischievous schemes, though his tactics always seem to backfire.\n\nOota is known as the class clown and is constantly disciplined by his teacher, who claims \"his face gives it away.\" To no fault of his own, he lacks control of his emotions and facial expressions. Kashiwada, on the other hand, seems perpetually emotionless and unreadable—no one knows what she is thinking!\n\nOota and Kashiwada are complete opposites, but that does not stop a unique relationship from developing between them. As they realize their feelings for each other, it raises an important question: do opposites really attract?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Saddled with amnesia, Yuuri awakens on an interstellar cruiser drifting through space. Unfortunately, a lack of memories is the least of Yuuri's problems. Among the four other crew members is a Gnosia: a Gnos infectee whose goal is the eradication of humanity. The Gnosia appears human in all other respects, so the uninfected have little choice but to vote on whom they suspect to be the enemy, hoping to neutralize the Gnosia by putting them into cold sleep. If the Gnosia survives the vote, they will eliminate one crew member during the cruiser's following warp, when only the Gnosia remains conscious.\n\nVoting quickly proves to be an unreliable strategy, and Yuuri is left one-on-one with the Gnosia. Just when all hope seems lost, time seemingly loops back to when Yuuri first awakened. With each time loop, however, conditions aboard the ship change—neither the size of the crew nor the members' identities remain constant. Trapped in both time and space, Yuuri must figure out how to escape the loops and save humanity from the Gnosia.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Fighting alongside King Ying Zheng of Qin—who seeks to unify China and end the chaos—Xin leads his own unit, the Fei Xin Force, onto the battlefield.\n\nWith power reclaimed from the influential Chancellor Buwei Lü, King Ying Zheng begins laying the groundwork for a new, unified legal state with the support of key allies like strategist Changping Jun and legalist Li Si.\n\nAs Qin launches a campaign to seize new territory from the state of Zhao, their advance is halted by the brilliant strategist, Li Mu. In response, Changping Jun devises a bold plan: to bypass Zhao's defenses and strike at the key city of Gyou, near Zhao's capital.\n\nTo carry out this risky maneuver, a powerful coalition army is formed—led by the tacticians Ou Sen (Wang Jian), Kan Ki (Huan Yi), and the warrior queen Yo Tan Wa (Yang Duanhe). Joining them are the next generation of Qin commanders: Xin's Fei Xin Force, Mou Ten (Meng Tian)'s Gaku Ka Unit, and Ou Hon (Wang Ben)'s Gyoku Hou Unit, each operating independently.\n\nThe fierce battle for Gyou begins, as the future of Qin's unification hangs in the balance.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
