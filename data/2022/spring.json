    "synopsis": "Corrupt politicians, frenzied nationalists, and other warmongering forces constantly jeopardize the thin veneer of peace between neighboring countries Ostania and Westalis. In spite of their plots, renowned spy and master of disguise \"Twilight\" fulfills dangerous missions one after another in the hope that no child will have to experience the horrors of war.\n\nIn the bustling Ostanian city of Berlint, Twilight dons the alias of \"Loid Forger,\" an esteemed psychiatrist. However, his true intention is to gather intelligence on prominent politician Donovan Desmond, who only appears rarely in public at his sons' school: the prestigious Eden Academy. Enlisting the help of unmarried city hall clerk Yor Briar to act as his wife and adopting the curious six-year-old orphan Anya as his daughter, Loid enacts his master plan. He will enroll Anya in Eden Academy, where Loid hopes she will excel and give him the opportunity to meet Donovan without arousing suspicion. \n\nUnfortunately for Loid, even a man of his talents has trouble playing the figure of a loving father and husband. And just like Loid is hiding his true identity, Yor—who is an underground assassin known as \"Thorn Princess\"—and Anya—an esper who can read people's minds—have no plans to disclose their own secrets either. Although this picture-perfect family is founded on deception, the Forgers gradually come to understand that the love they share for one another trumps all else.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Blessed with insurmountable power, Leo easily repels Echidna's army, thereby saving the world. But instead of gratitude or admiration, Leo is met with disdain and scorn from his fellow humans, who fear his overwhelming strength and believe that it may eventually cause humanity's demise.\n\nBanished from the kingdom he once called home, Leo wanders aimlessly throughout the land until, one day, he hears rumors of Echidna's efforts to rebuild her army. Hoping that demonkind might accept him as an ally, he returns to the demon queen's castle and offers Echidna his help.\n\nNaturally, Echidna immediately rejects him. Still, not all hope is lost, as Leo manages to convince Echidna's four generals to let him secretly work under their supervision. Donning the identity of a masked dark knight named Onyx, Leo solves the demon army's problems one by one—gradually improving the quality of life around the castle. Above all else, however, Leo wants to accomplish one goal: to learn why Echidna started the war in the first place.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a result, he felt alienated from his fellow humans, leading him to desire true companionship—an equal he could call a friend.\n\nHoping his fate will change in his next life, Varvatos decides to start anew and reincarnates three thousand years later as Ard Meteor, the son of a seemingly ordinary couple in a rural town. Unfortunately, he realizes that even after weakening himself, his strength still overshadows everyone in this era. Moreover, his lack of social skills bars him from achieving his goal of making friends. But worst of all, the repercussions of suddenly abandoning his former position have begun to bite him back in some of the most unimaginable ways possible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The weariness and regret stemming from the seemingly never-ending war catch up to him, and as he draws his final breath, Kongming wishes that if he were to reincarnate, he would be reborn in a more peaceful era.\n\nHis wish comes true, and Kongming wakes up in modern-day Tokyo with a younger body and his memories intact. Thrust into an unfamiliar world, he finds his way into a nightclub and meets Eiko Tsukimi, an aspiring singer whose performance immediately captivates him. Pitying his confusion, Eiko takes Kongming under her wing and teaches him about the current world, which leads to Kongming's interest in contemporary music. Seeing Eiko's immense musical potential, Kongming vows to make the world recognize her and soon takes on the role of her manager.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the music industry is unforgiving to those who make even the slightest mistakes. Still, Kongming is determined to accomplish his goals—even if he must utilize the war stratagems he famously used in his previous life!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Known for his unpredictable moves and self-centered playing style, Ashito is the sole powerhouse pushing his team through an important high school preliminary tournament. However, their win streak is short-lived—an opponent causes Ashito to lose his temper and act violently, resulting in his removal from the rest of the game.\n\nWithout their star player, the team is quickly eliminated from the tournament. Just as he believes all hope is lost, Ashito is approached by a youth team coach named Tatsuya Fukuda who senses potential in him, and Fukuda invites him for tryouts in Tokyo. In an unfamiliar setting surrounded by talent, Ashito must bring out the best of his ability to prove himself and secure what could be a life-changing career.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As he has no memories of his time before attending the institution, when Headmaster Albus tasks him with a special training regimen in the south, Sable eagerly accepts it. Alongside the Dawn Witch, Roux Cristasse; Holt, a human girl with antlers; and Kudd, a lizard Beastfallen, Sable must establish a village of witches in a region where anti-witch sentiment remains strong.\n\nDuring their journey, the quartet avoids former members of the Dia Ignis Arbiters—a group of witch hunters notorious for murdering witches and civilians alike. Five years ago, their organization was disbanded and given amnesty with the end of the war between the Church and witches, but their members still linger and are ready to capture any mages they come across.\n\nThankfully, with Roux's Staff of Ludens, the \"witch-eater,\" and Sable's unlimited supply of magic, the group may be able to accomplish their mission for Albus. If not, Sable's memories of magic and the academy will be taken away, and he will be left with nothing to guide him to the silver-haired mage who first rescued him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unable to replicate the exact conditions of the trip, the two stubborn scientists decide to seek help from elsewhere in the university—the Biological Sciences department.\n\nAssisted by fellow graduate students and longtime couple Chris Floret and Suiu Fujiwara, Yukimura and Himuro begin to quantify their feelings by measuring their output of oxytocin in various romantic situations. The two scientists soon find that their feelings for each other are nothing compared to that of a mature couple. It is here that Chris poses a question to both Yukimura and Himuro: what will they do if their \"affection\" is proven not to be love after all?\n\nDesperate to find a scientific rationale for the discrepancy, Yukimura puts everything on the line to prove that their \"love\" is real.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He finally decides to return after hearing that his father—owner of the Kyoto sweets store Ryokushou—has been hospitalized. Worrying that no one would inherit the shop if his father passes away, Nagomu prepares himself to embrace his family's legacy and the art of making sweets⁠.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nagomu discovers that his father has already chosen a different successor—a 10-year-old girl named Itsuka Yukihira, who was abandoned at Ryokushou by her father for reasons unknown. While she has since become a part of the family and is now the shop's poster girl, Itsuka still longs to see her father and follows all possible clues that may lead her to him. Sympathizing with Itsuka's situation, Nagomu's mother asks Nagomu to act as Itsuka's father, hoping that Itsuka will open up to him and relieve her pain, even if just a little.\n\nStarting on bad terms, Itsuka and Nagomu gradually learn more about each other, realizing that they are more similar than they had thought. Connected by their mutual love for both Ryokushou and its confections, their relationship as child and father figure begins to make lives around them a little bit sweeter.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But for Junpei, nothing could be worse than his peers finding out about his secret passion for ballet and perceiving him as effeminate. That is why he is in the soccer club, trains Jeet Kune Do, and is intent on following in his father's footsteps of becoming a stunt coordinator: all very \"manly\" activities.\n\nWhen Junpei's classmate Miyako Godai spots him demonstrating an impressive kick that combines skills from ballet and Jeet Kune Do to his friends, she suddenly recruits him to join her mother's ballet studio. He resists at first, and although he has abandoned his dreams of formally pursuing ballet, nothing quite captures the euphoria that ballet elicits. After suppressing his desire to pursue ballet for so long, it is not so easy to shake off his hesitation and break free of the shackles of masculinity. Junpei has to be willing to make certain sacrifices and fully commit to ballet, all while risking losing some friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Following the conclusion of the large-scale coalition campaign, the entirety of China is in a state of economic recovery. The victor of the battle, the state of Qin, is no different. There, the political parties led by Ying Zheng and Buwei Lü continue their inner conflict. Having played the role of king in the coalition battle, Zheng has the trust of the people—but Lü is far from out of the fight. In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng's coming-of-age ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, Lü slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng's half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement.\n\nHowever, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao's army. With trouble quickly brewing in the shadows, the internal struggle of Qin is only complicated further. There are only two men Zheng feels he can rely on: Bi, a general who commands 30,000 men; and Xin, the leader of the Fei Xin force.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Wanting to make a name for himself, a young human warrior named Alvin intends to start his career by completing a low-level request for the guild.\n\nWhile en route, Alvin is confronted by a magical bear and immediately finds himself in a pinch. As luck would have it, a dark elf healer named Karla approaches and asks if Alvin requires assistance—being seemingly oblivious to the situation before her eyes. After a discussion needlessly complicated by Karla's absurdly eccentric personality, Alvin somehow convinces her to help him. Unfortunately, instead of healing him, she accidentally casts a curse: if Alvin strays too far from her, he shall die.\n\nDespite being forced to accompany Karla until the curse is broken, Alvin remains steadfast in his ambition to become a full-fledged adventurer. With a partner by his side, the journey toward his goal may grow easier—or harder—depending on Karla's whims.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As he grows fond of the sport, Ryou works tirelessly to improve his badminton skills until he qualifies in the prefectural tournament. Lacking a coach who can bring out his full potential, he does not consider entering a high school with a strong badminton team. Instead, he plans on attending a local high school where he can play badminton for fun.\n\nHowever, Ryou's perspective changes when Yokohama Minato High School's badminton coach scouts him. Not only does the institution have one of the strongest badminton teams in the region, but it also has Kento Yusa, a player Ryou admires. Though hesitant at first, Ryou decides to enroll with the support of his sister. Possessing a firm ambition, he begins to gain experience with the proper guidance of a coach—all in hopes of surpassing Yusa one day.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Pointing out its many absurdities, she proposes that the academy is actually a stand-in for the afterlife.\n\nYuri's theory makes everyone restless; some begin questioning and even second-guessing their own memories. However, not all agree with the notion, defending the fact that their current existence is a result of their past rather than the interference of an omniscient being. Life at Kaginado Academy continues to be frenetic—despite how much the students want it to be otherwise!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In the distant future, the cities of Japan have been walled off and isolated from one another. Tourism and immigration are heavily controlled—if not impossible. Each region is overseen by an AI moderator that maintains its domain as it sees fit. These clusters are refined into a single ideal, with every citizen fulfilling their role in preserving the moderator's creation. But not everyone is satisfied with the narrowly focused vision of the city they were born in, and thus, they require some under-the-table help in relocating to a more appropriate cluster.\n\nDuring the day, Equa, Ferres, and Martese are ordinary high school students; but at night, they act as Extractors—people who illegally smuggle civilians between the city borders. Transporting those brave enough to leave everything behind, Equa and her friends risk their lives in order to give their clients a second chance. But the dangers of extraction begin to intensify when the cluster moderators become increasingly aware of the group's actions that threaten their perfect utopias.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As they venture further, they discover a mysterious spaceship and enter it out of curiosity. To their surprise, they come across Yuudias Velgear, an alien from the Velgear Star Cluster. As it turns out, Yuudias is seeking to learn about Rush Duel—a card game popular among elementary school students—as he believes that it will save his home from a long war.\n\nWith the siblings agreeing to teach Yuudias about Rush Duel, they eventually realize that their first contact with an alien may not be a random coincidence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
