    "synopsis": "In Tokyo's downtown district of Ikebukuro, amidst many strange rumors and warnings of anonymous gangs and dangerous occupants, one urban legend stands out above the rest—the existence of a headless \"Black Rider\" who is said to be seen driving a jet-black motorcycle through the city streets.\n\nMikado Ryuugamine has always longed for the excitement of the city life, and an invitation from a childhood friend convinces him to move to Tokyo.

    "synopsis": "Fumizuki Academy is not a typical Japanese high school. This unique institution has implemented a new and innovative system to sort its students. At the end of their freshman year, students take a test that divides up the student body. The highest scorers are placed into A class, all the way down until F class, for the lowest of the low.\n\nUnfortunately for Akihisa Yoshii, his supposedly \"great\" intellect was not quite enough for such a test, and he is now stuck at the bottom of F class. Naturally, F class has the worst facilities: not only rotten tatami mats and broken tables, but also outdated equipment and worn out furniture. On the bright side, his friend Yuuji Sakamoto is in the same class, and to everyone's surprise, the genius girl Mizuki Himeji has also ended up in the same class due to an unforeseen fever on the day of the test.\n\nUnsatisfied with their perquisites, F class rallies behind Yuuji, determined to take on the higher-tiered classes in order to seize their perks by using the school's Examinations Summon Battle system. The participants can summon fantasy characters—whose power levels are equal to their student's test scores—in an all-out battle. Will F class be able to rise to the top, or will they live up to everyone's expectations and fail?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The enigmatic seventh head of the Kyotouryuu school, Shichika lives quietly in exile with his sister Nanami until one day—the wildly ambitious strategist Togame barges into their lives.\n\nTogame brazenly requests that Shichika help in her mission to collect twelve unique swords, known as the \"Deviant Blades,\" for the shogunate. Shichika accepts, interested in the girl herself rather than petty politics, and thus sets out on a journey. Standing in their way are the fierce wielders of these legendary weapons as well as other power-hungry entities who seek to thwart Togame's objective. In order to prevail against their enemies, the duo must become an unbreakable team as they forge ahead on a path of uncertainty and peril.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The only problem he has to worry about while attending school alongside Rinko, his next-door neighbor, is his cat allergies.

Luckily, he is saved by Himari, a mysterious cat-woman with a sword, who explains that Yuuto is the scion of a family of demon-slayers, and she is there to protect him now that the charm that kept him hidden from the supernatural forces of the world has lost its power.\n\nOmamori Himari chronicles Yuuto's dealings with the various forces of the supernatural world, as well as the growing number of women that show up on his doorstep, each with their own dark desires. Will Yuuto be able to adjust to his new \"exciting\" environment? Or will the ghost of his (ancestor's) past catch up with him?",

Using her family's wealth to pay off the nation's debt, they have agreed to let her build this safe-haven for her fellow creatures of the night. But not everyone is so easily swayed by Mina's influence, as her announcement brings about conflict with humans who believe that the queen's quest for peace is a façade.\n\nAkira Kaburagi does not believe in vampires and gets uneasy whenever they are brought up, although he has yet to realize why. Apart from suffering a head injury a year ago, he lives on blissfully until he meets Mina. She triggers within him memories of a life he had long forgotten, and he soon begins protecting her without understanding why. But Akira's secret is far stranger than he could have ever thought possible—he discovers that he is a werewolf, sworn from birth to protect the vampire queen, even if it costs him his life. Now, as these two dance a rondo of death in the Vampire Bund, Mina and Akira find out just how deep their bond goes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While some teenagers might have to worry about fitting in or feel out of place in a new environment, Hiroshi is welcomed enthusiastically at school by most of his new classmates. In fact, it seems like they just can't get enough of him, and he makes two friends rather quickly: the clingy and overly-affectionate Isuzu Tsumuhana, who is also his neighbor; and Kaname Asagiri, who also recently moved to Jouga. All in all, Hiroshi's new life seems to be quite normal—until people start disappearing.\n\nHiroshi is told that the missing townsfolk have simply moved away or suddenly transferred, but he can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. Meanwhile, in the dead of night under a red moon, masked individuals led by a girl with a scythe stalk their prey in the darkened streets of Jouga. Who are they, and are any of the residents safe from their wrath?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The 2D animation \"Qin Shi Mingyue: Xiao Chuangjianghu\" series (2 parts) is a Q-extra version of the Chinese 3D martial arts animation \"Qin Shi Ming Yue\" series, but the plot has changed a lot compared to the original 3D series, and it cannot be imagined as the plot of the original 3D series, where the characters' personalities, etc. have also been changed. In short, the anime modernized, dramatized, and made the original 3D series funny.\n(The animation is original in terms of script, production, and drawing style and is not an adaptation of Jing Ding Comics' comic book version of the same name.)\nThe work tells the hilarious story of Tianming and his companions.",
