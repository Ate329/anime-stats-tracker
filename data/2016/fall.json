Due to this, he faces an enormous amount of pressure, both from the shogi community and his adoptive family. Seeking independence from his tense home life, he moves into an apartment in Tokyo. As a 17-year-old living on his own, Rei tends to take poor care of himself, and his reclusive personality ostracizes him from his peers in school and at the shogi hall.\n\nHowever, not long after his arrival in Tokyo, Rei meets Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto, a trio of sisters living with their grandfather who owns a traditional wagashi shop. Akari, the oldest of the three girls, is determined to combat Rei's loneliness and poorly sustained lifestyle with motherly hospitality. The Kawamoto sisters, coping with past tragedies, also share with Rei a unique familial bond that he has lacked for most of his life. As he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally through his shogi career, Rei must learn how to interact with others and understand his own complex emotions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Serinuma can't help but to fantasize about her male classmates falling for each other and enjoys imagining them together. A more known fact about Serinuma, however, is that she’s noticeably overweight. \n\nWhile watching her favorite show one day, Serinuma witnesses the death of her most beloved character. Utterly depressed, she can't muster up the energy to eat her meals, let alone attend school. After an entire week, she finally recovers. But now there's something unusual about her—during the time she refused to leave her room, she ended up losing a large amount of weight and has somehow become strikingly beautiful!\n\nNow catching the eye of everyone who sees her, she finds herself at the center of attention of four boys she has always known at her school. Though they all wish to spend time with her, Serinuma would much rather they spend time falling in love with one another. How will Serinuma deal with the four boys pursuing her BL-obsessed self?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The daily shenanigans of the four prisoners always cause trouble for the building supervisor, Hajime Sugoroku, who desperately tries to prevent them from breaking out of Nanba.\n\nNanbaka follows the comedic, sparkle-filled exploits of these prisoners and their guards. From three square meals a day to sports festivals, prison life in Nanba isn't actually that bad—and it is the closest these four have to a home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Nonetheless, Natsume never fails to show the same kindness to the benevolent youkai and happily returns their names by using the infamous Book of Friends he inherited from his late grandmother, Reiko.\n\nMeanwhile, the exorcist clan Matoba still wishes for Natsume to join their ranks due to his overwhelming gift. However, Natsume firmly rejects the clan's invitation since not all exorcists are as reasonable as his friend Shuuichi Natori, and many improperly and indiscriminately seal away every youkai in their way. Unsatisfied with Natsume's answer, Seiji Matoba blackmails Natsume into attending a grand gathering of powerful exorcist families. Natsume soon finds himself in the company of dangerous people and youkai alike. But even then, he continues to defy the exorcists' hard-handed methods and believes that peace between both worlds is possible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Boasting a far superior military and having achieved profuse success earlier in the war, it was expected that Germania would conquer Elystadt with ease.\n\nMatters are only made worse for the small country when Germanian soldiers capture their princess, Ortfiné \"Finé\" Fredericka von Eylstadt, as she is heading to a crucial meeting with Britannia. Yet, when a concurrent Germanian transport mission goes awry, Izetta, the last witch alive, escapes. When she recognizes Princess Finé from her childhood, Izetta rescues her from the Germanian soldiers by making use of her magical abilities. Now reunited with the princess, Izetta pledges to protect Elystadt from Germania, and with the last surviving witch on their arsenal, Elystadt hopes to turn the tides against the imperialist war giant. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Whoever collects the least amount of Magical Candies—which are awarded for their magical girl activities—in their competition each week will lose their powers. But when a real-world tragedy happens to the first player that drops out, they are shown the repercussions of losing their abilities. As more participants inevitably lose the competition and more twisted rules are added, the girls soon realize that their \"contest\" is actually a desperate fight for survival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Eager to explore the island, Satoshi and Pikachu run wild with excitement, quickly losing their way while chasing after a Pokémon. The pair eventually stumbles upon the Pokémon School, an institution where students come to learn more about these fascinating creatures.\n\nAt the school, when he and one of the students—the no-nonsense Kaki—have a run-in with the nefarious thugs of Team Skull, Satoshi discovers the overwhelming might of the Z-Moves, powerful attacks originating from the Alola region that require the trainer and Pokémon to be in sync. Later that night, he and Pikachu have an encounter with the guardian deity Pokémon of Melemele Island, the mysterious Kapu Kokeko. The Pokémon of legend bestows upon them a Z-Ring, a necessary tool in using the Z-Moves. Dazzled by their earlier battle and now in possession of a Z-Ring, Satoshi and Pikachu decide to stay behind in the Alola Region to learn and master the strength of these powerful new attacks.\n\nEnrolling in the Pokémon School, Satoshi is joined by classmates such as Lillie, who loves Pokémon but cannot bring herself to touch them, Kaki, and many others. Between attending classes, fending off the pesky Team Rocket—who themselves have arrived in Alola to pave the way for their organization's future plans—and taking on the Island Challenge that is necessary to master the Z-Moves, Satoshi and Pikachu are in for an exciting new adventure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Rugby is a sport where anybody can be a star when they hold the ball. The rules are simple: one player has to carry the ball past the goalposts across the field while avoiding the other team, who are allowed to use all their force to knock the enemy down. However, the player can pass to a teammate behind them or kick the ball before they are tackled. Unlike other sports, the game continues even when the person holding the ball is taken down.\n\nKenji Gion is a short but feisty high school freshman at Kanagawa High School. Right after the school's opening ceremony, he meets the tall and timid Sumiaki Iwashimizu, and the two of them get an invitation to observe the rugby club. \n\nWhen Gion watches the match, he realizes that even though big and tall guys have an advantage, there are positions for people of all shapes and sizes. Immediately convinced that he has found a sport he can excel at despite his short stature, he signs up, though Iwashimizu declines. Gion is unable to accept Iwashimizu's excuses and drags him back into the sport. Their training becomes intense as they aim to become the champions of Hanazono, the national high school rugby championships.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, she gets into an altercation with gangsters that leaves her with injuries; luckily, martial arts champion Einhald Stratos finds Fuuka and brings her to a hospital.\n\nSeeing potential in Fuuka's skills, Einhald encourages the girl to become a martial arts athlete and offers her a job at Nakajima Gym, where Einhald trains. Despite the kind gesture, Fuuka initially declines the proposal due to the bad memories it brings. She was once childhood friends with the now prominent martial arts athlete Rinne Berlinetta, but the personality of her fellow orphan shifted from kind and gentle to cold and cruel after being adopted by a prosperous family and starting martial arts.\n\nNonetheless, Fuuka soon accepts Einhald's offer and begins training under her—not only out of necessity but also out of the desire to defeat Rinne and make her realize how hurtful her behavior has become. Despite Fuuka's inexperience, Einhald and the other members of the gym have faith in her talent and efforts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With this discovery, other Musik users are drawn to Otowakan, including Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, and Franz Schubert. However, not all Musik users have innocent desires.
