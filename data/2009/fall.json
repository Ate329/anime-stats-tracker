    "synopsis": "In the enchanted Kingdom of Fiore, the lively Lucy Heartfilia has one wish: to join the renowned Fairy Tail—one of the many magical wizard guilds scattered around the continent. Luckily, a chance encounter with Natsu Dragneel, the \"Salamander\" of Fairy Tail, whisks her into the legendary guild.\n\nFrom Natsu's rivalrous antics with ice wizard Gray Fullbuster to the frightening presence of the unmatched combat goddess Erza Scarlet, Fairy Tail's powerful mages have a slight penchant for trouble. Through all the lucrative odd jobs and adventures to save the world from destruction lies an absolute and unyielding trust stronger than family that has formed between each guild member.\n\nTeaming up with Natsu, Gray, and Erza, Lucy finds herself amidst the guild's most misfit wizards. But as they constantly stand in the eye of every danger, there is one name that never ceases to resurface: Zeref, the feared master of dark magic.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately for him, though, he is surrounded by cat lovers: his family, his estranged childhood friend, and even his crush Kaede Mizuno.\n\nOne day, while returning home from school, Junpei nonchalantly attempts to kick an empty can into the trash, but miserably misses. Instead of making it to the garbage, the can ends up breaking off the head of a cat deity statue. That fateful day, he is cursed with the ability to understand cat speech. However, he must keep his curse a secret from everyone else, because anyone who finds out will become more accident-prone and share the same fate as him.\n\nWith the guidance of his cat Nyamsus and with no other choice left, Junpei now has to do a hundred good deeds for cats to lift the curse. If he is unable to complete this task, he will turn into a cat, and considering his allergy, that would be a death sentence for him!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Along with his best friend Yuka, they try to decipher why they have been sent to this strange world, which is seemingly empty aside from themselves.\n\nHowever, when the \"Red Night\" ends, Kakeru and Yuka believe it was all a dream—until it happens again, and they are left in a dangerous situation. They meet four others in the same predicament: Kusakabe Misuzu, an expert swordswoman; Tachibana Kukuri, a strange mute girl who looks uncannily like Kakeru's deceased sister; Hirohara Yukiko, a lively young girl whose personality reverts to that of a cold killer when her glasses are removed; and Tajima Takahisa, a young pyrokineticist.\n\nAs the six of them band together to survive and discover what this mysterious world is, things take a turn for the worse as six shadows appear before them...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is exactly the kind of life that high school student Ken Sugisaki leads, or so he thinks!\n\nUsually, the officers of Hekiyou Academy's student council are elected by popular vote, but an additional position is granted to the student who scores the highest on the exams. Ken, who historically has had below average grades, worked hard to improve them to be accepted into the student council, with the ultimate goal of surrounding himself with girls who fawn over him.\n\nUnfortunately for the vice president, things do not go quite as planned. Not only do the ladies of the council continually rebuff his advances, they also prefer to focus on more important and \"boring\" activities, such as organizing school events and managing the other clubs. But a few minor hurdles like these won't stop Ken from chasing after his dreams, even if they seem a bit ridiculous.  \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now, inexperienced knight Cecily Cambell is eager to follow the example of her family and protect the people of the city using the sword she inherited from her father.\n\nHer first challenge arises in the market. A crazed swordsman wreaks havoc upon civilians and Cecily jumps into action to restore order. Overwhelmed, her weapon shatters, but a skilled stranger wielding a strange-looking sword intervenes. With the situation diffused, Cecily heads to a local blacksmith in an effort to restore her family heirloom. However, she finds out that her savior—the blacksmith Luke Ainsworth—may be the only person capable of such intricate repairs. Determined to have her treasured sword repaired, she seeks out the man who rescued her.\n\nHowever, a group of bandits suddenly attack a convoy headed for the city. The assailants look inhuman, and an ice demon appears. Luke suspects the use of a demon contract and calls upon a sacred power to defeat them. Meanwhile, a shadowy hooded figure lurks, watching from a distance. Who is this mysterious evildoer, and what does his appearance mean for the pair?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On the other hand, the doctor seems to have three separate personalities: a child with an oversized lab coat; an intelligent, youthful man with feminine traits; and a selfish, outgoing green bear. While curing his patients in questionable ways, Dr. Irabu often tries to gain something from them outside of his profession—and in doing so, occasionally forgets his role as a doctor.\n\nAs each patient struggles to face the nature of their distress, an obvious yet invisible thread ties their paths together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With four of the five members graduating this year, the state of next year's Guardians Council is up in the air. In an effort to ensure the council's survival, the group recruits two \"Guardian Apprentices\" in the hopes that they will develop their own Heart's Egg someday.\n\nOne of the Apprentices they take on is Rikka Hiiragi, a spunky and upbeat girl who is capable of communicating with X Eggs. As the Guardians have not been able to speak with these Eggs previously, Rikka's uncanny ability intrigues them. However, Rikka fears that she will never be accepted as a full-fledged Guardian if they ever find out what exactly she does with her ability. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
