Without warning, Mami breaks up with him, leaving him utterly heartbroken and lonely. Seeking to soothe the pain, he hires a rental girlfriend through an online app. His partner is Chizuru Mizuhara, who through her unparalleled beauty and cute demeanor, manages to gain Kazuya's affection.\n\nBut after reading similar experiences other customers had had with Chizuru, Kazuya believes her warm smile and caring personality were all just an act to toy with his heart, and he rates her poorly. Aggravated, Chizuru lambastes him for his shameless hypocrisy, revealing her true pert and hot-tempered self. This one-sided exchange is cut short, however, when Kazuya finds out that his grandmother has collapsed.\n\nThey dash toward the hospital and find Kazuya's grandmother already in good condition. Baffled by Chizuru's presence, she asks who this girl might be. On impulse, Kazuya promptly declares that they are lovers, forcing Chizuru to play the part. But with Kazuya still hung up on his previous relationship with Mami, how long can this difficult client and reluctant rental girlfriend keep up their act?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

There he befriends karate specialist Han Dae-Wi and swordswoman Yu Mi-Ra, who both have entered for their own personal reasons. Mo-Ri knows that no opponent will be the same and that the matches will be the most ruthless he has ever fought in his life. But instead of being worried, this prospect excites him beyond belief.\n\nA secret lies beneath the facade of a transparent test of combat prowess the tournament claims to be—one that has Korean political candidate Park Mu-Jin watching every fight with expectant, hungry eyes. Mo-Ri, Dae-Wi, and Mi-Ra are about to discover what it really means to become the God of High School.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Finding a way to turn the Infernals back into people, unraveling the mystery of the Evangelist and Adolla Burst, and saving his mother and Shou—these are the goals Shinra has in mind. However, he has come to realize that attaining these goals will not be easy, especially with the imminent danger the Evangelist poses.\n\nThe Evangelist's plan is clear: to gather the eight pillars—the individuals who possess Adolla Burst—and sacrifice them to recreate the Great Cataclysm from 250 years ago. Having been revealed by the First Pillar that the birth of a new pillar is approaching, Shinra is determined to protect his fellow pillars from the Evangelist. Thus, the fiery battle between the Special Fire Force and the Evangelist ignites. Together with the Special Fire Force, Shinra's fight continues as he uncovers the truth about the Great Cataclysm and the nature of Adolla Bursts, as well as the mysteries behind human combustion. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To put an end to this seemingly endless conflict, Demon King Anos Voldigoad willingly sacrificed his life, hoping to be reborn in a peaceful future.\n\nIn preparation for their king's return, the demon race created the Demon King Academy, an elite institution tasked with determining Anos' identity when he reawakens. He reincarnates two millennia later, but to his surprise, he soon learns that the level of magic in the world has drastically waned during his absence. Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently. His personality, his deeds, and even his legacy are all falsified—masked beneath the name of an impostor. This \"lack\" of common knowledge renders him the academy's outlier—a misfit never before seen in history.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Anos remains unfazed. As he sets out to uncover those altering his glorious past, he takes it upon himself to make his descendants recognize that their ruler has finally returned.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, after swindling a seemingly clueless tourist, Makoto discovers that he was the one tricked and, to make matters worse, that the police are now after him. \n\nWhile making his escape, he runs into the tourist once again, who turns out to be a fellow con man named Laurent Thierry, and ends up following him to Los Angeles. In an attempt to defend his self-proclaimed title of \"Japan's Greatest Swindler,\" Makoto challenges his rival to determine the better scammer. Accepting the competition, Laurent drops them off outside a huge mansion and claims that their target will be the biggest mafia boss on the West Coast.\n\nAs Makoto becomes increasingly involved with the cunning Laurent, his colorful associates, and the world of international high-stakes fraud, he soon realizes that he got more than what he bargained for as his self-declared skills are continually put to the test.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, much to her surprise, the once active senior has ended up becoming a \"lonesome\" student, preferring to spend his free time in quiet peace.\n\nUzaki does whatever she can to keep Sakurai from being \"alone,\" from convincing him to go to the movies to going to his part-time workplace. While Sakurai finds her irritating and tiresome, he still goes along with Uzaki's hijinks and shenanigans, even if he knows that her perky personality will only lead the two of them into various comical situations.\n\nEven so, as the days pass by, their relationship only gets better, to the point where people around them misinterpret them to be a couple. At any rate, whenever Uzaki wants to hang out with her upperclassman, fun and adorable wackiness is sure to follow!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Far in the future, the lifeforms known as Gadoll suddenly arose as a threat to humanity. The last surviving humans on Earth confine themselves to the Tank, a lower district in the giant mobile fortress Deca-Dence. While the Gears who live on the upper floors are warriors who go out to fight as part of the Power, most Tankers are content to provide support from the backlines, butchering Gadoll meat and reinforcing defenses. Natsume is among those who would rather go to the front lines; undeterred by her prosthetic right arm, she seeks to join the small number of Tanker soldiers who join the Gears in combat. \n\nBut despite her peers at the orphanage each receiving their work assignments, Natsume’s enlistment to the Power remains unapproved. In the meantime, she begins a job as a cleaner in an armor repair team led by the hard-nosed and apathetic Kaburagi, who seems to be more than he lets on. Though initially cold to his idealistic subordinate, he soon recognizes in her the potential to upset the status quo of the world. As Natsume’s new mentor, Kaburagi prepares her for the special and unique role as a game-changing bug in the system.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "After her father passed away, a young woman inherited his production company, Miracle Entertainment, along with its most successful program, \"Miracle Finder.\" In recent years, however, the show has fallen off the radar and it is now mostly forgotten. In an attempt to save the show from being canceled, this young woman desperately tries to look for a unique topic to use as inspiration. She finds it in the form of \"Evol,\" a mysterious gene that has granted certain people special powers and is considered the next step in human evolution. But, as marvelous as this gene seems, its existence may lead to an unstoppable battle between humans for survival.\n\nHowever, as she becomes more entangled with the strange world of the \"Evolvers,\" her life is suddenly disturbed by the arrival of four men: the cheerful idol Kira; the neuroscientist and Loveland University professor, Simon; the stoic CEO of Loveland Financial Group and Miracle Entertainment's benefactor, Zen; and her high school upperclassman Haku, a former delinquent now working as a police officer.\n\nAs strange incidents begin to plague the city, will she be able to find out the truth about the \"Evol\" or \"Black Swan,\" the organization behind numerous attacks from \"Evolvers\" and possibly connected to her father's death? What is her part to play in its plan, and how are the men around her connected to it all?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Tiara, a princess from the kingdom of Waleland, travels to the city of Mamkestell to attend a prestigious academy for those who practice magic like herself. After passing a test to prove her eligibility, Tiara reunites with her childhood friend Rosetta, who is also a student there. She then joins and meets Rosetta's group: the athletic Lavie, the reliable Ashley, and the bookish Lynette—all of whom Tiara quickly befriends.\n\nIn this institution, students are placed into one of three ranks based on their test score: group Noir being the highest, followed by Rouge and Lapis. Tiara's group is ranked Lapis, and if that was not enough, those who fail while ranked Lapis face expulsion. Realizing their dire situation, Tiara urges everyone to start taking their activities more seriously.\n\nOn top of this, Tiara has one more purpose for excelling at the academy: to become more like her elder sister, who is a very skilled singer. However, to reach the stage that she desires, she will have to overcome many challenges, along with her companions, as she continues her magical journey.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Vincent, a timid vampire, can transform into a bat. Sena, who is cynical and competitive, has a speed of light. Lucky is an angel who is always bright. Dino is a scientist who transforms into a dinosaur when he's angry.\nThese five kids claim to be the problem solvers at school, but they often ruin things even more because they are impatient and clumsy. However, in order to become a hero who fights against real villains someday, Hero Circle continues to search for accidents in school, today as well.\n\n(Source: Official Website, translated)",
