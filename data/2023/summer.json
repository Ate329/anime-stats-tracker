    "synopsis": "The year is 2006, and the halls of Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School echo with the endless bickering and intense debate between two inseparable best friends. Exuding unshakeable confidence, Satoru Gojou and Suguru Getou believe there is no challenge too great for young and powerful Special Grade sorcerers such as themselves. They are tasked with safely delivering a sensible girl named Riko Amanai to the entity whose existence is the very essence of the jujutsu world. However, the mission plunges them into an exhausting swirl of moral conflict that threatens to destroy the already feeble amity between sorcerers and ordinary humans.\n\nTwelve years later, students and sorcerers are the frontline defense against the rising number of high-level curses born from humans' negative emotions. As the entities grow in power, their self-awareness and ambition increase too. The curses unite for the common goal of eradicating humans and creating a world of only cursed energy users, led by a dangerous, ancient cursed spirit. To dispose of their greatest obstacle—the strongest sorcerer, Gojou—they orchestrate an attack at Shibuya Station on Halloween. Dividing into teams, the sorcerers enter the fight prepared to risk everything to protect the innocent and their own kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, his joy is short-lived, as Eris suddenly abandons him to embark on her own journey. Believing that Eris has lost all interest in him, a heartbroken and depressed Rudeus sets forth to the Northern Territories. With his sole goal being to locate his mother on the vast continent, Rudeus wonders if persisting through daily life is worth the pain, falling into a robotic routine as he endlessly ruminates on his lost love.\n\nHowever, the dangers of the North soon prove that one cannot survive with a dulled mind. While on a quest with the party Counter Arrow, with whom he recently became acquainted, Rudeus has a brush with death—an experience that forces him to finally snap out of his despair.

Although she grants him overpowered magical abilities in this new world, when he awakes as the newborn Prince Reinhardt, his talents are only measured at Level 2. Thinking their child to be an abysmal failure, his royal parents abandon him in the woods. There, the prince, who names himself Haruto, encounters Flay, a Flame Fenrir who decides to devote her life in service to him. Haruto's relative, Gold Zenfis, meets them both in the woods and decides to adopt the child as his own.\n\nNine years pass with Haruto under the care of the Zenfis family. His mastery over his overpowered barrier magic increases by the day, though Haruto would rather not use it to help others. He practices his magic in secret, preferring to have his family believe that he is weak. However, his younger sister, Charlotte, discovers his strength, and with the assistance of Flay, Haruto protects her and the rest of the Zenfis family from harm. With a shifty plot stirring in the kingdom, Haruto only wishes to stay inside and watch anime, but it seems he will have to use his magic to keep the family that took him in safe.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the encouragement of his childhood friend Eiko Houzuki, he becomes a private tutor. Since he is at the top of his intake class, his first client is the tutoring firm's most promising student, Yayoi Houzuki.\n\nTo Keitarou's surprise, Yayoi is Eiko's cousin, and she possesses two pupils in each eye—allowing her to see into the spirit world and purposely seek vengeful spirits to exorcise. Ever since a car accident killed both her parents, Yayoi has been searching for the powerful spirit that kidnapped her mother's departed soul. Seeing that spirits are so attracted to Keitarou, she ropes him into helping her collect other evil spirits that will assist in her future fight. Although her quest is dangerous, Keitarou reluctantly decides to join her, even as each new spirit they meet has him questioning his resolve at every turn.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Hiroto Shinohara is a new transfer student to Academy Island, where games determine student rankings. The more games won, the more stars a student has, with the highest ranking being that of a Seven Star. On Hiroto's first day, he accidentally antagonizes Sarasa Saionji, the so-called Empress of Academy Island and granddaughter of the island's head director. Forced into a game fueled by misunderstandings that he somehow ends up winning, he is thrust into a major bluff where he must lie about his ranking or risk expulsion from the school and island.\n\nFortunately, with the help of the mysterious Company headed by Shirayuki Himeji, Hiroto is not alone in his bluff. The Company will do everything in its power to help him cheat his way through the game challenges sent his way by students wanting to beat him. Though he is a One Star student, he must fight as though he is actually a Seven Star, and overcome insurmountable odds in his quest to search for a missing girl from his past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although he is a modern appliance in a fantasy world, he requires money in order to keep functioning. He is stuck in one location until a young girl named Lammis stumbles upon him. Amazed by the drinks and food he sells, Lammis uses her \"Blessing of Might\" to lift him with ease and take him back to the village of Clearflow Lake. There, she officially dubs him Boxxo.\n\nDespite his inability to converse with the villagers, Boxxo becomes an essential part of the community. His goods provide nourishment, and, as he gains new abilities and products, he becomes a staple of daily life. Nobody is as loyal to Boxxo as his first and best customer, Lammis. The more time he spends with her, the more he tries to help her elevate her skills as a young hunter.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Even after he is hospitalized due to exhaustion, his days of toil only become worse. Soon enough, the sheer fatigue catches up to him and kills him in his sleep. However, Ryouta is given a second chance at life: he wakes up in another world as a slime drop—much to the surprise of Emily Brown, the petite blonde girl who defeated said slime.\n\nAcquainting himself with the rules of this RPG-like world, Ryouta finds out that he will never grow past level 1. However, he also discovers that one of his skills is at the maximum level: the skill which determines the rarity of monster drops. This allows him to acquire not only items of the best quality, but also some that are unheard of.\n\nRyouta sets out to make the most of his ability—meeting new friends, grinding through dungeons, and acquiring unique items along the way. Reveling in his new life seems to be the long-awaited and much-deserved reward for all the tribulations he had suffered.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the war over, its infamous hero Hitokiri Battousai disappeared into thin air, leaving only his legend behind.\n\nYears later, a seemingly plain wanderer named Kenshin Himura encounters Kaoru Kamiya, the owner of a struggling local dojo in Tokyo. Kaoru pursues a self-proclaimed Battousai who roams the streets, indiscriminately killing citizens and police officers. Furthermore, the warrior professes to use the Kamiya Kasshin-ryu—a sword style developed by Kaoru's father deeply rooted in the essence of life, not death.\n\nKenshin decides to help Kaoru take down the impostor and restore her father's dojo. Unbeknownst to all, Kenshin is none other than the real warrior whose name still terrifies the people. Although Kaoru eventually learns the truth, his oath to atone for his murderous history by bloodlessly protecting the weak moves her, and she welcomes Kenshin to stay at her dojo. However, Kenshin's ideals are soon challenged by ghosts of the past and enemies of the present.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, chaos ensues when the girl he had fallen for greets him at the door. After the commotion settles, he discovers the temple is actually a nunnery from which his father had borrowed millions before fleeing. Now working at the nunnery to repay the outstanding debts, Akemitsu tries his best to compose himself and stay celibate while being surrounded by lovely girls of all kinds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although she wakes up by herself, Noir has lost her memories and is of no help in Kanata's work. However, amid an Enders attack, Kanata discovers that Noir possesses remarkable combat abilities. The pair now embarks on a journey to not only shed light on Noir's past but also to uncover the location of Histoire—the mythical city harboring secrets of the world that Kanata has always dreamt of visiting.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The trio questions Botan's family about their intentions regarding Hyouma's presence near the person embodying the frontier between the human and marebito worlds. Soon after, the paper umbrella tsukumogami that Hyouma had been pursuing for years suddenly reappears and abducts Botan along with her university friends. Rushing to save the one he swore to protect, Hyouma might have to change his priorities if he wants to keep his promise to Botan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In their last year of middle school, the five band members of CRYCHIC went their separate ways after an unpleasant disbandment. Each wrestling with their own regrets, the girls enrolled in different high schools, hoping never to hear from one another again.\n\nMeanwhile, Anon Chihaya transfers to Haneoka Girls' Academy in the middle of the school year. As most students play in a band as a hobby, Anon desires to fit in and spends her first days trying to recruit members for her own band, envisioning herself as the group's vocalist. She befriends Tomori Takamatsu, a shy girl who seems interested but hesitant about joining. As it turns out, Tomori used to be part of CRYCHIC, an experience that has scarred her deeply.\n\nThrough Tomori, Anon meets Taki Shiina and Soyo Nagasaki, both former members of the same band. Although Taki detests the idea of playing with Anon, Soyo is delighted to help her out. Now with Soyo by her side, Anon's dream of forming a band is within reach—if only she could find a few more members.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
