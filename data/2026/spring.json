    "synopsis": "In the deadly battle at the Watergate City of Priestella, Subaru and his allies barely emerged victorious—but their triumph came at a great cost. Through the \"Authority of Gluttony,\" Rem was put into suspended animation, while Crusch's memories and even Julius’s name were devoured. As he searches for a way to save them, Subaru learns of the \"wise man\" Shaula—an all-seeing being said to possess every form of knowledge. His next destination is the Pleiades Watchtower, home to a wise man, the farthest tower standing in the vast, uncharted desert known as the Auguria Dunes—a place so perilous that even the mightiest \"Sword Saint,\" Reinhard, failed to conquer it. The fury of nature, unknown magical beasts, and unimaginable dangers lie ahead. Together with his friends, Subaru embarks on a life-risking journey to reclaim what was lost.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa)",

Worse yet? It seems one of the new first-years is also from the White Room. Can Ayanokouji avoid expulsion while sussing out the identity of this hidden foe?\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

However, when Coco takes advantage of a golden chance to spy on the skilled witch Qifrey, she realizes that her favorite picture book was a disguised magic book all along! In her excitement, she immediately starts testing out the various spells.\n\nWhen a spell causes a disaster in her home, Qifrey rescues her just in time and decides to train her, realizing that she is the first lead he has found that could help him track down the Brimmed Caps—a dangerous group of heretics who experiment with forbidden body-altering magic and spread magical artifacts among the commoners. But before Coco and Qifrey can confront the Brimmed Caps, she is going to have to improve her magical skills and learn to get along with Qifrey's other apprentices. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In an isolated village, two twins were born, separated by day and night. It is years later, and while the older brother Yuru has become a hunter of animals, his sister Asa has been locked away in a cage, ordered to perform a special duty that prohibits her from meeting more than a few select individuals.\n\nOn an otherwise inconspicuous day, a group of armed men riding in helicopters, referred to as \"dragons\" by the citizens, assaults the village in search of Yuru, killing every adult on sight. When Yuru attempts to meet up with Asa and flee, he finds a dead body instead—on top of that, the person who killed her claims to be Yuru's true twin sister.\n\nBefore the woman can capture him, Yuru is rescued by a man named Dera, an outsider who frequently visits the village. However, it is not long before the two are cornered. In a last-ditch effort, Dera makes Yuru give a gift to the deity of the village, summoning a pair of daemons whose existence is bound to reveal the truth behind these chaotic events.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite being clandestinely referred to as the \"second cutest girl in class\" by the boys, she chose to spend her Fridays with me instead of her best friend Amami, who held the \"cutest girl in class\" title. In the comfort of my home, we delved into the realm of games, watched movies, immersed ourselves in manga, indulged in junk food—pizza, hamburgers—and guzzled cola, carefree and content. To the outside world, we might have seemed a bit messy, but to both Asanagi and me, it was a cherished, hidden time together.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

But just as she prepares to claim her meal, things take a very unexpected turn.\n\nInstead of devouring him, Kanan ends up forming a \"romantic contract\" with Youji. For someone who's lived for millennia without experiencing love, navigating high school romance proves more terrifying than any hunt. Between awkward dates, hand-holding mishaps, and feelings she can't quite name, the once-proud demon finds herself flustered at every turn.\n\nA supernatural romcom about a lovestruck demon and the boy who was supposed to be her prey—sweet, chaotic, and full of firsts.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

    "synopsis": "For centuries, the Poison Masters have perfected the art of assassination. Among them, the Gero family stands as one of the five most powerful families of Masters, wielding unmatched skill and influence. Hikaru Gero, heir to this infamous bloodline, has lived his life deep in the shadows of the underworld, far removed from love or marriage.\n\nHowever, to ensure the Poison Master bloodline does not die out, the head of the Gero family declares that Hikaru's sister will be forced to bear an heir. Soon after, Hikaru crosses paths with Mei Kinosaki, a brilliant marriage swindler who also happens to be his current assassination target. Determined to protect his sister and solve the succession problem himself, Hikaru makes an unexpected request on the spot—asking Mei to help him get married.\n\n\"...That's the first time anyone's ever proposed like that.\"\n\nAnd so, with the cunning marriage swindler Mei as his advisor, the elite assassin Hikaru sets out on the toughest mission for love. His goal? The ultimate marriage. The most unlikely duo—an assassin and a marriage swindler—take on the world's toughest mission for love!\n\n(Source: Official site)",

Ever since she could remember, Akane Ousaki has been mesmerized by her father Tooru's rakugo performances. Peeking in behind a sliding door, she would spend hours watching and mimicking his work.\n\nFor Tooru, the only thing separating him from that coveted rank is a promotion test in front of an audience and a senior rakugo master, Issho Arakawa. Despite his passionate performance, Tooru finds himself expelled from the rakugo school following the exam. This makes him give up on rakugo entirely and settle for a regular job, breaking his daughter's heart.\n\nFilled with grief and anger, Akane now seeks vengeance on the man who refuses to see the genius behind her father's rakugo style. She begs Tooru's former rakugo master, Shiguma Arakawa, to take her under his wing. But Shiguma feels unworthy of taking on another pupil after what happened to her father six years prior. In order to see if she has what it takes to enter the rakugo world, Shiguma urges Akane to test her resolve by performing in front of an audience.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Among them, one pristine consort-in-training, Reirin Kou, stands out as the perfect candidate for the future empress. Her virtue and elegance are unrivaled, and she is flawless—save for her extremely sickly constitution. Compared to the court's gentle butterfly, the boorish Keigetsu Shu is like a sewer rat. Always staring at Reirin with bitter envy, Keigetsu is a disgrace to the Maiden Court.\n\nDuring the night of a rare comet sighting, Keigetsu's jealousy reaches its peak, and she attempts to murder Reirin by pushing her off a balcony. Reirin is quickly saved from death, and Keigetsu is imprisoned to await her execution. Unbeknownst to all, Keigetsu has cast a spell to swap bodies with Reirin in order to steal all that belongs to her. But while Keigetsu is hindered by Reirin's frail body, Reirin fully embraces freedom and physical strength for the first time in her life, determined to live—no matter whose face she wears.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Upon graduation, these students find themselves at the top of their field or employed by the royal family.

Claude is a world-renowned sorcerer who became the institution's youngest instructor, but mysteriously disappeared soon after.\n\nLacking the experience and connections required for admission, Spica finds herself unable to make meaningful progress with her training. One day, however, she meets a talking black cat with magical abilities. Hoping to change the situation for the better, she begs the animal to take her as his apprentice and teach her the magic she needs to attend the academy. The cat accepts the deal on one condition—she must find a way to reverse his feline curse. Despite the arduous challenges ahead of her, Spica is determined to prove herself as a student worthy of the cat's mentorship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Tabata Wakana aspires to be a musical star; housemaster Takehara Kinue attends to carry on her best friend's wishes; beautiful Okabe Emi is a scholarship student who is always at the center of attention; and Ibuki Katsurako, who became a teacher at the school though originally from a family of actresses.\n\nThe unique environment of the musical school is simultaneously a respite space for these aspiring girls and also a harsh battleground that pits young students against each other. It is a place where perseverance can lead to blossoming talents, but also to a cruel reality at times. The clear depiction and psychological portrayal allow the subtle inner workings of each character to come through.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival, edited)",

Never sleeping or resting, Luck endures the clash of swords, rain of blood, and never-ending stream of enemies. Against all odds, he vanquishes the commander and emerges victorious, only to find that 10 whole years have passed in the meantime. Furthermore, his body has regressed in age to the point where he looks like a mere teenager.\n\nFollowing his triumph, Luck soon reunites with his friends, the hero Eric Imgard Mendirival and warrior Goran Morton. As they believed Luck to be dead, the pair made sure he went down in history as a hero and prepared to quell the rise of the demons themselves, unaware of Luck's feat. With all this in mind, Luck just wants a laid-back life, so he applies as a novice adventurer under the name Lock and sets out on a journey alongside brand new companions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Shizuku Kanzaki is the only son of world-renowned wine critic Yutaka Kanzaki. From a young age, Shizuku has been subjected to strange education from his father all for the sake of wine. From learning to gracefully decant a drink to intently remembering the smell of leather belts and pencils, the training causes him to grow resentful of everything related to wine. Discontent with his father, he leaves home to become an average sales representative for a beer company, refusing to ever touch wine again.\n\nWhen his father suddenly passes away, Shizuku finds himself being dragged back into the world he hates so much. As part of his father's will, the one who will inherit his prized wine collection and estate will be the person who can correctly identify the \"12 Apostles\" of wines as well as the legendary \"Drops of God.\" In order to inherit the assets, Shizuku has one year to complete the task, but he finds the proposition ridiculous when he is the only living relative of Yutaka.\n\nWhat Yutaka failed to tell his son before his death was that he had adopted Issei Tomine into the family a week prior to his passing. Issei is a famous veteran wine critic competing against Shizuku to claim the estate for himself. With no formal training in wine tasting, Shizuku stands no chance against \"The Prince of Wine\" and is at risk of losing everything in this competition. Will he be able to correctly identify the elusive \"Drops of God\" before he runs out of time?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
