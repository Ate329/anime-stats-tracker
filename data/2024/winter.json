    "synopsis": "Humanity was caught at a precipice a decade ago when the first gates—portals linked with other dimensions that harbor monsters immune to conventional weaponry—emerged around the world. Alongside the appearance of the gates, various humans were transformed into hunters and bestowed superhuman abilities. Responsible for entering the gates and clearing the dungeons within, many hunters chose to form guilds to secure their livelihoods.\n\nSung Jin-Woo is an E-rank hunter dubbed as the weakest hunter of all mankind. While exploring a supposedly safe dungeon, he and his party encounter an unusual tunnel leading to a deeper area. Enticed by the prospect of treasure, the group presses forward, only to be confronted with horrors beyond their imagination. Miraculously, Jin-Woo survives the incident and soon finds that he now has access to an interface visible only to him. This mysterious system promises him the power he has long dreamed of—but everything comes at a price.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Adventuring knight Laios Touden leads a small party through a seemingly endless dungeon, a subterranean maze full of dangerous monsters and precarious traps. Through the use of advanced magic, an explorer can sometimes be resurrected, allowing them to learn from past mistakes and give traversing the dungeon another go. However, when a powerful dragon eats Falin, Laios' spellcasting sister, she sends her brother and his companions back to the beginning to save them from permanent ends.\n\nThough strapped for cash and equipment, Laios resolves to fight his way through the dungeon and rescue Falin before she can be digested by the dragon. Despite some of Laios' allies abandoning him, two remain by his side: elven mage Marcille Donato and halfling locksmith Chilchuck Tims. Due to their lack of funds, the party faces the daunting prospect of starving before being able to complete their quest. However, they find salvation in Senshi, a dwarven warrior with a penchant for cooking and safely eating defeated monsters.\n\nWith Senshi's culinary expertise, Laios and his companions struggle through the dungeon while learning about gourmet dining—and each other—along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, during her commute, Yuki meets fellow student Itsuomi Nagi, a multilingual travel enthusiast and friend of Rin.

    "synopsis": "As his school days draw to an end, Yuuki Wakura worries about his future. While lamenting the prospect of living an ordinary life, he is suddenly drawn into the world of Mato: an alternate dimension filled with dangerous monsters called Shuuki. Over the years since the existence of Mato was first confirmed, incidents of people accidentally wandering into the other world have become commonplace. To combat the threat of the Shuuki and rescue victims like Yuuki, the all-female Demon Defense Force was established. Its members have been blessed with the power of \"Peaches\"—Mato fruits that grant supernatural abilities only to women.\n\nThough Yuuki's situation is dire, he is saved in the nick of time by Kyouka Uzen, the chief of the Demon Defense Force's seventh unit. Despite Kyouka's impeccable skills in battle, she has long been held back by her Peach-granted ability, Slave. Slave allows Kyouka to put a living being under her control and draw out its strength, but the Shuuki that she had enslaved until now had all proven to be exceedingly weak.\n\nWhen Yuuki and Kyouka become surrounded by a horde of Shuuki, Kyouka resorts to something she has never tried before: using her ability on a man. To her surprise, Yuuki's slave form is much more powerful than she could have imagined. Believing the young man to be the key to unlocking her true potential, Kyouka invites Yuuki to join the Demon Defense Force—but not as a regular member.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But she would always get swept up in a war and die, so now she wishes for her seventh reincarnation to be easygoing and uneventful.\n\nWhat Rishe does not take into account is the presence of Arnold Hein, the crown prince of the Galkhein Kingdom. He is destined to usurp the throne and become a tyrant who starts a large-scale invasion of neighboring countries. To make their encounter worse, Arnold is the one who killed Rishe in her previous life. That is why it is all the more shocking when he proposes to Rishe on the spot.

Shockingly, he wakes up to find himself turned into a skeleton, the lowest class of undead monsters. As Rentt fights against the other monsters of the labyrinth, he discovers that slaying them gains him experience towards higher stages of undead evolution—even ones with flesh! With this revelation in hand, Rentt obtains a new objective in his undeath: keep evolving in the hope of eventually becoming a vampire, the highest form of undead that is nearly indistinguishable from human beings.\n\nDespite being forced to hide his past identity and monstrous nature under an unremovable mask, Rentt manages to return to a semblance of his former life. Granted shelter by Lorraine Vivier, an elite researcher and retired adventurer, Rentt assumes her surname and starts over from scratch as a rookie. Determined to pursue his childhood dream and become a mithril-class adventurer, Rentt must be cautious not to disclose his new bodily circumstances, lest the adventurers’ guild seek to exterminate the monster he has become.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It only takes a moment for Tsubasa's idealized view of Japan's northernmost prefecture to crumble, as the sheer cold and frigid air quickly overwhelm him. While trying to find the way to his new home, Tsubasa runs into Minami Fuyuki—a talkative and friendly Hokkaido native who, despite the cold, is wearing a short skirt. The girl wastes no time in striking up a conversation, and Tsubasa comes to realize that the winter weather is not all that is too much for him to handle.\n\nThe next day, Tsubasa is shocked to learn that not only is Fuyuki in his class, but her seat is also right next to his. Swept along by Fuyuki's persistent advances, the young man soon becomes captivated by both life in Hokkaido and the beautiful girl determined to get closer to him. As he deepens his relationship with Fuyuki and meets other fashionable girls from his school, Tsubasa finds out that Hokkaido gals truly are adorable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Yumiella Dolkness may be of noble descent, but her dark hair and rare dark-type magic—both associated with the Demon Lord—spark fear in anyone who sees her. When she is five years old, Yumiella regains memories of her previous life in modern Japan, also realizing that her fate is to become the hidden boss that appears after Alicia and her suitors defeat the Demon Lord.\n\nYumiella refuses to live as the game dictates and, as she prefers the game's fantasy elements over its romance, she decides to cultivate her magical skills and level up in secret. However, everything falls apart on the day of the Royal Academy's entrance ceremony. Yumiella's powers are measured at level 99—something thought impossible even for the royal knights, let alone a 15-year-old girl. With the royal family requesting her help, and everyone else insisting that she prove her strength, Yumiella realizes that her dream of a quiet life is no longer an option.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, a few are excluded from receiving a Gift, resulting in the others leaving them behind.\n\nYogiri Takatou, one of the students who did not receive a Gift, wakes up to find a dragon attacking the bus. Amidst the chaos, he executes the dragon using his innate ability to instantly put anything to death. Alongside fellow survivor Tomochika Dannoura, Takatou sets out to find a way back to Earth, all while eliminating anyone who dares to underestimate him—including his former classmates.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While Rin sees this as an opportunity to make a new friend, his twin brother, Yukio, is more burdened than ever. Swamped with his education, exorcist duties, and teaching position, Yukio has remained silent about his awakened powers, unable to understand their scale or significance.\n\nWhile Rin and his friends prepare for the annual Exorcist Certification Exam, the True Cross Order has uncovered the first artificial gate to the demonic realm of Gehenna. Witnessing its size and the advanced technology that made it possible, the exorcists realize they are now dealing with the Illuminati, an extremely wealthy and powerful organization. Moreover, the inscrutable Illuminati have planted three spies in the True Cross Order—and one may be hiding among the aspiring exorcists sworn to protect mankind from the demonic threat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Eager to claim this power for themselves, self-proclaimed demon kings from various worlds assemble in the New Principality of Lithia to fight for it. Among them, master swordsman Soujirou Yagyuu seeks to take this coveted position for himself. Joined by Tooi Kagizume no Yuno, a young girl he saved from an army of golems that destroyed her city, Soujirou enters Lithia to battle his way to the title.\n\nAt the same time, the leaders of the Aureatia Kingdom seek to destabilize Lithia by launching bandits after the convoys of merchandise transiting through the principality. Enraged, Imashime of Taren, the founder of Lithia and defector from Aureatia, sends vicious thief Kasasagi no Dakai to investigate the origin of these attacks. With war on the brink of eruption, no one can predict what influence the contenders for the demon king's throne will have on the coming conflict.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To his great surprise, his fate takes a brutal turn after he decides to adopt a Java sparrow that he names Pii-chan. The talking bird not only happens to be a reincarnation of a famous magician from another world, but it decides to grant some of its powers to Sasaki—along with the ability to traverse between worlds. Sasaki begins a lucrative business of selling technological items from his world to the less advanced civilization of the other.\n\nHowever, Sasaki's life becomes more chaotic when he stops an attempt on a woman's life with his new powers.  Unfortunately, the woman Sasaki saved also happens to be a government agent named Hoshizaki, who is tasked with tracking down gifted individuals like him. Forced to join Hoshizaki's secret agency, Sasaki partakes in dangerous missions to find other gifted criminals. He does not even have the luxury of hiding in the other world, where a war is about to break out. If he wants to protect peace in both worlds, Sasaki will have to become the hero that no one expects him to be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having fulfilled their purpose as soldiers, Neans became subservient workers and second-class citizens to humans. Requiring a daily dose of Nectar to sustain themselves, the androids depend on their masters for its supply of the drug.\n\nHowever, among this societal hierarchy lie Proto-Neans, independent specialized androids that can summon metallic exoskeletons with superhuman capabilities. Rouge Redstar is one such Proto-Nean working undercover for Aletheia, the government organization overseeing the regulation of Neans, alongside her human partner, Naomi Orthmann.\n\nRouge and Naomi's mission is to eliminate the Immortal Nine—Proto-Neans who threaten humanity for cryptic reasons. At the same time, an investigator is making his way to Mars to follow a series of murders where Rouge is considered the prime suspect. As the pair delve deeper into their search for the Immortal Nine, they uncover groundbreaking information about the rogue androids and the organization they work for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Elise's selfishness, insolence, and obsessive love for her fiancé—Prince Linden de Romanoff—led to the deaths of her family members and, eventually, herself. Only after being reborn did Elise realize the error of her ways and decide that, instead of ruining lives, she would devote herself to saving them. But a tragic airplane crash robs her of her dreams too soon.\n\nBy a miracle, Elise wakes up in her original body before her official engagement to Linden. Recognizing the chance to cherish her loving family and free Linden from an unwanted marriage, Elise wishes to use her advanced medical knowledge to continue down the path of saving lives. In a deal with the emperor, Elise is given only six months to prove that her true place is not on the throne, but rather with the wounded and ailing who desperately need her help.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a transfer student, Arajin Tomoshibi has no interest in getting involved; instead, his priority is finding a girlfriend. Fortunately for him, he is placed next to Mahoro Jin, the prettiest girl in the class who also seems to like him. However, she has an overprotective older brother, Marito—none other than the combative leader of Siguma Squad. Moreover, Arajin's reunion with his childhood friend, Matakara Asamine, spells trouble since Matakara is a member of Minato Kai.\n\nWith his rotten luck, Arajin also accidentally awakens the genie Senya, known as a Honki Person from ancient legends. Senya takes a shine to him because of the young man's fervent aspiration—despite it only being the loss of his virginity. While Arajin would be the first to flee from a fight, Senya lending him his powers helps the lovesick boy to hold his own against the likes of Marito, although this only raises the interest of both gangs in recruiting him. As the turf wars heat up when a third gang joins the fray, Arajin's involvement may be unavoidable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As her spirit leaves her body, God appears before her, offering Midori a second chance at life in another world called Asdyllon. There, she must observe how badly humans persecute other species and judge if they should continue existing.\n\nTo help her get started, God grants Midori a special ability: to be liked by all kinds of non-humans—whether it be animals or holy beasts—enabling her to embrace and cuddle them as much as she wants. Now reborn as Nefertima Osfe, a duke's daughter, she enjoys her new life to the fullest alongside her adorable companions. However, it will not be long before she discovers what her task truly entails and that her time in this world will not always be fluffy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "When mundane office worker Kiyoshi Adachi turns 30 years old, he discovers that he has gained the ability to read minds due simply to remaining a virgin for his entire life. The caveat, however, is that he must make physical contact with a person to know what they are thinking about. Adachi believes there is no real use for this power until he accidentally hears the thoughts of his coworker, Yuuichi Kurosawa.\n\nCharismatic and dependable, Kurosawa is the star of Adachi's team at work, earning praise and admiration from everyone at the office. But deep within, Kurosawa harbors an intense one-sided crush for the gloomy Adachi—a fact that Adachi only learns because of his ability, and knowledge he tries to respectfully disregard. As Kurosawa treats Adachi with kindness and affection he has never experienced before, Adachi finds it increasingly difficult to ignore his coworker's genuine advances.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thrilled by the opportunity to know more about her family, Himari arrives at the rumored haunted house and is bewildered to find three young men already living there: Aoi Nanamori, who identifies himself as the guardian of the place, and his two familiars, Yukari and Ise. Although they allow her to stay overnight, they warn her to leave the next day so she can avoid harm from ayakashi—wandering spirits that sometimes attack human beings.\n\nSurprisingly, Himari is unaffected by her spectral encounters and determined to move in to the residence. After she discovers that Aoi had become guardian unwittingly and is now confined to the property, forgotten by the outside world, her resolve only grows stronger. Touched by his story, Himari decides to find a way to free Aoi from his dim fate, and she convinces the three Momochi House protectors to accept her as their landlady. However, the mysterious Kasha who keeps sending hostile ayakashi to Himari's new home seems to have darker plans for Aoi's future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having partially recovered her memory, Noir reverted back to her former personality: that of Mystere, who acts in a patronizing manner toward her master Kanata. However, Mystere remembers detecting a signal from Histoire, a mystical city, during her former life as an artificially intelligent magus.\n\nMeanwhile, Tokio disappears from Rock Town while hunting down the ghosts of his past; however, shocking revelations await the deeper his search goes. As Kanata, his childhood friend Ellie, and the magus diva Ciel set out for Histoire, a hostile organization named Ideal sends assassins after them. If Kanata wants to stand a chance at accomplishing his dream, he must uncover the unpleasant truth about Ideal—and some of his closest allies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
