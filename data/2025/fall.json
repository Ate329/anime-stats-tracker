To this end, spy Loid Forger has managed to maintain his pretend family consisting of his telepathic daughter, Anya; assassin wife, Yor; and their clairvoyant dog, Bond. Still the only one aware of everyone's true identities, Anya tries to sustain the family's cohesion while working to befriend Donovan's son Damian, her Eden Academy classmate.\n\nHowever, Anya's efforts instead earn her another Tonitrus Bolt, bringing her closer to getting expelled and jeopardizing the operation's success. Hearing the news, Loid faints from shock. In his unconsciousness, he reminisces about his tragic past and his journey to becoming a spy. Realizing what Operation Strix means to him and the world, Loid finds renewed motivation. Although they each work toward their own covert goals, the Forgers continue to cherish their chaotic yet blissful family life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, the fun is cut short when Saku's homeroom teacher instructs him to convince his shut-in classmate, Kenta Yamazaki, to return to school. Wishing to wrap things up quickly, Saku visits Kenta's house the very next day. But the task proves more challenging than he expected when he discovers that Kenta is firmly and fully on the Saku hate train. If he wants to preserve his impeccable image, Saku must find a way to win over Kenta and bring him back to school. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to his terrifying skill in slaying monsters, Aristide has earned the title of \"Blood-Man Duke.\" Charmed by Melphiera's fearlessness and intriguing culinary prowess, Aristide  soon declares his intent to propose.\n\nTogether, Melphiera and Aristide, high society's most eccentric couple, strive to see beyond the cruel rumors and encourage each other's fascination with monsters and the art of preparing them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She has the power to transform her surroundings by manipulating the elements of the periodic table.

However, the spirit who fought by Rovel's side, Lady Origin, brought him to her realm to save him from the clutches of death. Lady Origin, who happens to be the Queen of the Spirit Realm as well as Ellen's eventual mother, is one of the most powerful spirits in existence, making little Ellen quite powerful in contrast to her innocent looks.\n\nBut even a family as happy as this one has its fair share of problems, as Ellen and her parents are forced to reconnect their old ties to the Vankreift household in order to defend their relatives' honor—all while hiding Ellen's dangerous existence from the public to preserve their undisturbed happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kashiwada, on the other hand, seems perpetually emotionless and unreadable—no one knows what she is thinking!\n\nOota and Kashiwada are complete opposites, but that does not stop a unique relationship from developing between them. As they realize their feelings for each other, it raises an important question: do opposites really attract?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In ancient China, during the Warring States period, a former servant named Xin rises through the ranks with a dream: to become the greatest general under the heavens. Fighting alongside King Ying Zheng of Qin—who seeks to unify China and end the chaos—Xin leads his own unit, the Fei Xin Force, onto the battlefield.\n\nWith power reclaimed from the influential Chancellor Buwei Lü, King Ying Zheng begins laying the groundwork for a new, unified legal state with the support of key allies like strategist Changping Jun and legalist Li Si.\n\nAs Qin launches a campaign to seize new territory from the state of Zhao, their advance is halted by the brilliant strategist, Li Mu. In response, Changping Jun devises a bold plan: to bypass Zhao's defenses and strike at the key city of Gyou, near Zhao's capital.\n\nTo carry out this risky maneuver, a powerful coalition army is formed—led by the tacticians Ou Sen (Wang Jian), Kan Ki (Huan Yi), and the warrior queen Yo Tan Wa (Yang Duanhe). Joining them are the next generation of Qin commanders: Xin's Fei Xin Force, Mou Ten (Meng Tian)'s Gaku Ka Unit, and Ou Hon (Wang Ben)'s Gyoku Hou Unit, each operating independently.\n\nThe fierce battle for Gyou begins, as the future of Qin's unification hangs in the balance.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
