Even so, he still has a lot to learn, and every new lesson seems to strengthen his love for sewing and for the hina dolls his grandfather taught him to make.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitagawa finds it harder and harder to hide her feelings for Gojou. Friends and strangers alike constantly mistake them for a couple, much to Gojou's embarrassment. After all, in his eyes, their worlds are far too different for anyone to think they could be romantically linked. However, as Gojou spends more time with Kitagawa and realizes that his passions are not ridiculed by other people, a relationship between the two no longer seems so far-fetched.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite the constant warnings from his adoptive father Regto, Rudo spends his days searching for reusable materials that would otherwise be sent to the giant disposal area known as the Pit. Due to its vastness, the Pit doubles as a means of criminal punishment; those dropped in are never to return again.\n\nWhen Regto is murdered by a mysterious assailant, Rudo is falsely accused of the crime and thrown into the Pit. To his surprise, he awakens in a trash-filled area inhabited by enormous monsters formed from the junk. As the toxic air and Trash Beasts push Rudo to the brink of death, he is saved by Enjin, one of the Cleaners who wield weapons known as Vital Instruments to fight the monstrosities. Having gained his own Vital Instrument, Rudo soon joins the Cleaners in the hopes of finding a way to escape the Pit and avenge his father.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kafka is the first kaijuu to side with humans, and after careful consideration, he is eventually transferred to the Defense Force's First Division in the hope of adding his power to the strongest division, capable of handling any threat. However, some people are still doubtful about Kafka, and he must prove his worth in the next mission.\n\nKafka and the First Division are soon dispatched when a massive horde of ant-like kaijuu begins wreaking havoc.

Certain that it is not the Hikaru he knows who came back, Yoshiki finally asks Hikaru about it. Suddenly, \"Hikaru\" reveals his true monstrous form and begs Yoshiki to keep it a secret, as he does not want to kill him.\n\nDespite his paranormal nature, \"Hikaru\" seems almost innocent, full of childlike wonder and eager to experience the summer heat, the countryside, and all kinds of other things in a human body for the first time. And for Yoshiki, it matters little if \"Hikaru\" is a fake relying on stolen memories—as long as he never leaves again. As Yoshiki desperately clings to \"Hikaru\" in his intense grief, it becomes increasingly clear that something dangerous and supernatural may have descended from the mountains into their village.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A lone man named Momotarou opposed these gruesome, near-invincible monsters, but the war against them was just beginning.\n\nThousands of years in the future, temperamental gun enthusiast Shiki Ichinose leads a carefree life. However, after his expulsion from school, everything changes. Shiki is suddenly attacked by a man and is rescued by his adoptive father, Tsuyoshi. As the two flee, Tsuyoshi reveals that Shiki is actually a descendant of the Oni, while both he and their pursuer are from the Momotarou lineage.\n\nThe two Momotarou soon clash in a fierce battle, and Tsuyoshi sacrifices himself to protect Shiki. Devastated, Shiki awakens to his Oni blood that grants him immense strength at the cost of going berserk. Although the enemy escapes, Naito Mudano, an Oni teacher at Rasetsu Academy, takes an interest in Shiki. Under Mudano's guidance, Shiki must learn to control the Oni blood—if he ever hopes to avenge his father.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His favorite faction within the game—Mynoghra—was infamously complex to navigate and skewed toward evil; moreover, he insisted on playing at the highest difficulty.\n\nAfter his untimely death, Takuto awakens in a world uncannily reminiscent of Eternal Nations. He is reincarnated as the King of Ruin, sovereign of Mynoghra itself. At his side stands Odei no Atou, the default hero unit of his chosen nation. Remembering every battle they fought together, she pledges unwavering loyalty to Takuto once more.\n\nAs Takuto begins to build Mynoghra from scratch in this new world, his early-game strategy remains unchanged: lie low, avoid war, and ensure survival at all costs—ironic for an evil ruler meant to conquer the world. When he offers refuge to persecuted Dark Elves fleeing destruction, a fledgling empire born of a darkness the world has yet to understand begins to take shape.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The trio ends up living together in the same apartment and attempt to navigate their lives in the city of City, where unexpected and out-of-the-ordinary things occur daily.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The tropical Seiren Island is a paradise for deviants: the infamous Pervert Law grants complete sexual freedom with no taboos or boundaries. With its various suggestive attractions, the Seirantou Health Organization (SHO) entices visitors while providing regular medical checks and contraceptive pills to ensure carefree enjoyment.\n\nHowever, for high school student Junnosuke Tachibana, the island is far from ideal. Having recently moved there with his younger sister, Asane, he cannot stand the empty, loveless sexual acts. To make matters worse, Junnosuke's abstinence attracts unwanted attention—and those who defy the law face punishment.\n\nJunnosuke soon crosses paths with Nanase Katagiri, a notorious island seductress. Surprisingly, instead of forcing herself on him, she helps him flee from the SHO. Together, they discover a secret group that exists for a singular goal: to destroy the SHO. Now equipped with a way to resist the unjust rules, Junnosuke and other kindred spirits set out to crush the Pervert Law.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When she realizes that the best way to get Atori to notice her is to be a delinquent, she begins to dress differently: she dyes parts of her hair a bright red, wears clips on her ears to resemble piercings, and attaches jumbo erasers to her shoes to give them thicker soles.\n\nDespite Yuu's best efforts and even with the advice of her \"natural born delinquent\" friend Suzu Suzukaze, all of her plans to be a bad girl go awry. Still, Yuu manages to befriend Atori and pledges to spend as much time as possible together, not knowing there are others vying for Atori's attention. In the process, Yuu has also gained the attention of the school's self-proclaimed idol, Rura Ruriha, filling her once-invisible life with more attention than she may be able to handle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But a motorcycle accident sends Takeru to Denji Heian-kyo—an alternate version of Japan's ancient capital with futuristic technology and the home of the girl from his dreams, Tsukiyima, who does not recognize him.\n\nHowever, a black mist soon descends upon the city, petrifying citizens and unleashing monsters called oni. Only the so-called onmyouji—sorcerers who wield mystical powers and pilot magical \"shikigami\" suits—can fight them. When the mist returns, Takeru discovers that he has strange transformation powers and can resist the oni. But he and Tsukimiya are ultimately killed, and Takeru awakens in Denji Heian-kyo once again, this time two weeks before the appearance of the mist. Swearing to protect Tsukimiya at all costs, Takeru vows to become an onmyouji and change the future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Miko Kurono is a lesser-known streamer, \"Necronomico,\" who plays video games for her small audience. She has been covering the hospital bills of her close friend and fellow streamer, Mayu Mayusaka, ever since she and other popular streamers mysteriously fell into a coma three months ago.\n\nDesperate for money, Miko agrees to participate in a top-secret beta test for a cutting-edge VR game. After clearing the first level, she and six other streamers come face-to-face with the Old Ones—ancient, evil gods who have returned to take over the Earth but are currently trapped inside the VR world. Miko becomes enraged when she discovers that one of the gods, Cthulhu, has taken the likeness of Mayu and is the one responsible for her condition.\n\nAlongside the others, Miko is now a part of the Old Ones' twisted game called the Cosmic Horror Show, where the elimination of all the players results in humanity's doom. However, knowing that the winner is granted a single wish, Miko sets out to beat the game and save Mayu.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With her namesake talent in singing, she attempts to join her school's light music club but repeatedly fails due to her extreme shyness and lack of confidence. Intimidated by the dazzling presence of the club's members, Uta fears to even submit her application.\n\nOne day, Uta receives an invitation from Airi Kojou, president of the a cappella club, to check out their club instead. Unlike the light music club, this group performs purely without instruments. Uta soon finds herself amazed by the way the members' voices resonate with one another—delicate yet cohesive, resembling a mille-feuille dessert's thousand layers. Moved, Uta takes a quiet step forward into creating a harmony where everyone shines together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When they finally manage to catch it, it turns out to be a talking Pallas's cat named Nuru!\n\nNuru has come from the distant future with a serious mission to inform them that the Earth is facing an impending threat of destruction. While he says he wants to protect the Earth, he says he's only come to warn them of the crisis, and that it's up to the five of them to decide whether or not they want to fight for the Earth...\n\nIsn't this just an attempt to dodge responsibility? The Defense Club members are suspicious. \"If either is fine with you, I'll do it! That's more fashionable!\" Unzen enthusiastically says. The five decide to fight with free will, and Nuru transforms them into the Haikara Romantic Troupe using feline science.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious trio called the Bankara New Elite Squad are scheming in the shadows. They are plotting to take over the Earth.\n\n(Source: Official site, translated and edited)",
