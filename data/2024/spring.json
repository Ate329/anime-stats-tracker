    "synopsis": "After a series of mighty clashes with Upper Rank Demons, the Ubuyashiki clan prepares for one last battle with the hellish forces of Muzan Kibutsuji. In order to finally defeat the Demon leader once and for all, the clan devises a training camp for the Demon Slayer Corps, one led by the remaining Hashira—the most elite warriors in the organization. Each Hashira forms a specialized exercise that will hone both their own abilities and the skills of the ordinary soldiers.\n\nTanjirou Kamado, a boy at the heart of the brewing conflict, recovers from wounds received in a recent fight. While his half-Demon sister Nezuko is studied by researchers like Shinobu Kochou, Tanjirou embarks to train with the Hashira, seeking mastery in each of their assigned areas of expertise to be best prepared for the coming war—skills vital to Tanjirou, as he has vowed to be the very warrior who will eliminate Muzan for good.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "After the destruction of their hometown, childhood friends Kafka Hibino and Mina Ashiro make a pact to become officers in the Defense Force—a militarized organization tasked with protecting Japan from colossal monsters known as \"kaijuu.\" Decades later, the 32-year-old Kafka has all but given up on his dreams of heroism. Instead, he cleans up the remains of the slaughtered kaijuu after they are defeated by valiant soldiers—including Mina, who has successfully achieved their shared goal.\n\nUpon meeting his new coworker, Reno Ichikawa, Kafka faces a mirror of his past self: an ambitious young man whose one desire is to fight as a member of the Defense Force. Unfortunately, the two are soon involved in a freak encounter with a rogue kaijuu. Though Kafka demonstrates his innate heroic nature and rescues Reno from certain doom, he is left gravely injured.\n\nWhile both men recover in a hospital, Kafka is seemingly attacked by another one of the beasts. As a result, he gains the ability to transform into a humanoid kaijuu with the strength and powers of the massive monsters menacing Japan. Dubbed \"Kaijuu No. 8\" by the military, Kafka resolves to use his newfound gifts for the greater good. Tied together by mutual respect, Kafka and Reno set out to join warriors like Mina at the forefront of the Defense Force.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The research he is helping Shizuka Nanahoshi conduct hits a bottleneck, sending her into a deep slump much like he experienced in his previous life. Furthermore, a letter from his father, Paul, brings complications to Rudeus' relationships, and Sylphiette still knows next to nothing about his real background. In the face of these issues, Rudeus will have to apply the lessons he has learned in this new world to navigate through the challenges that come with living a life to its fullest.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Following their recent exploits, the party is one step closer to vanquishing the Demon King and his armies—a terrifying task that Kazuma is eager to ignore for as long as possible. Things, however, are not going as smoothly as the group would like; they are constantly racking up debt, getting sidetracked during missions, and falling into traps due to their recklessness and eccentricities.\n\nAs the party struggles with their perennial issues, they receive an invitation from a princess interested in hearing tales of the group's \"heroic\" deeds. Darkness' pleas to refuse the invitation only fire the others up to accept it, marking the start of yet another uncanny adventure with unforeseen consequences.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Furthermore, the Western Holy Church continues its intolerant crusade against Rimuru and his non-human subordinates.

Instead of the usual rejection, they fight alongside him, demonstrating that what the school actually cares about is protecting the town of Makochi from any harm—hence why the students call themselves \"Bofurin.\" Surprised by the support and appreciation of the townspeople, Sakura has a hard time accepting their goodwill.\n\nThough unfamiliar with kindness being shown to him, Sakura must learn to push past his discomfort when Bofurin is pitted against formidable enemies. After experiencing the feeling of acceptance, he finds himself fighting for the sake of others for the first time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Yet, as time passed, such stories became little more than relics of the past.\n\nAfter quickly finishing his business in the village, Lawrence sets out to his next destination. His journey, however, takes an unexpected turn when he discovers a nude, animal-eared girl sleeping among his pelts. Even more surprisingly, the youthful-looking woman claims to be Holo—the wolf of legend.\n\nHolo wishes to return to her hometown in the north, and though their first encounter is rocky, she convinces Lawrence to accompany her on her travels. In return, she vows to earn her keep, using her quick wits and lifetime of experience to help her newfound companion in his dealings. As they continue their journey, Lawrence and Holo take advantage of whatever economic opportunities they come across, often landing in situations that put both their business skills and their relationship to the test.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now reincarnated into his current royal lineage, he receives a body with seemingly endless mana, making his desire to master all things arcane attainable. Moreover, as the seventh prince of the kingdom, Lloyd has no claim to the throne, allowing him to nurture his abilities as freely as he wants.\n\nUnfortunately for Lloyd, ancient seals that imprison powerful demons begin to break down and release the horrors within, endangering the peace. With these monstrosities roaming around, Lloyd's overwhelming magical prowess is the ultimate weapon that can neutralize these threats before all things descend to chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, Banaza does not gain any exceptional powers at level one as hero candidates usually do, and he has no way of returning to his old world. As compensation, he is sent to live in a faraway forest. Upon arriving, Banaza levels up once and suddenly gains limitless powers that he now has no idea what to do with.\n\nTo avoid drawing attention, Banaza changes his appearance and assumes the name Flio. While away from home, he stumbles across a young demi-human girl named Fenrys, who is seemingly searching for the same forest Flio was sent to. However, she attacks him and reveals her true identity—a lupine demon. Luckily, Filo's unrivaled magic overpowers Fenrys, and she swears undying loyalty to him. However, Flio refuses to hold power over her; the two instead begin pretending to be a married couple and embark on a new life together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When attending the deceased Archdemon's estate auction, Zagan finds something he did not expect: love at first sight. The sorcerer impulsively spends all his money to take Nephelia, a rare elf slave, back to his castle. Given the girl's mysterious and troubling past, there is a lot for Zagan to uncover about his new companion.\n\nHowever, Zagan's lack of experience with the unfamiliar feeling of love leads to many awkward moments between him and Nephelia, whom he calls by the nickname \"Nephy.\" As the two grow closer and get more comfortable around each other, it becomes increasingly evident that Nephy's feelings might not be so different from Zagan's.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Luckily, the Dragon Keepers are here to save the day! Having defeated the majority of the monsters during their initial invasion, the heroes now routinely show up to clear away any remnants of resistance. Unbeknownst to the public, however, every fight beyond the first has been a deliberate show put on by both sides: the Dragon Keepers reap the fame and prestige from fighting imaginary enemies, while the surviving weakest monsters, altogether called Dusters, are allowed to live for another day.\n\nSentouin D, a Duster tired of living this life of shame, leaves the fortress in an attempt to overturn his fate. With the unexpected help of the mysterious ranger Yumeko Suzukiri, he discovers the key to defeating the Dragon Keepers lies in their Divine Artifacts—ultimate weapons crucial to the rangers' transformation and unique powers. Teaming up with Suzukiri to infiltrate the garrison of Red Keeper Sousei Akabane, Sentouin D must defy all expectations to save his species from the cruel hands of humans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As Ars grows older and learns more and more about his new environment, he becomes convinced that war will soon erupt.\n\nFortunately, though Ars was not blessed with unrivaled strength or extraordinary magical aptitude, he does possess Appraisal: a seemingly unique skill that allows him to instantly grasp someone's current abilities and latent talents merely by looking at them. In an effort to prepare his domain for the imminent strife, Ars resolves to enlist the most exceptional people he can find, paying no attention to superficial qualities like race or social status.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "As a young boy, Prince Oscar Lyeth Increatos Loz Farsas was cursed by the Witch of Silence, rendering it all but impossible for any woman to bear him a child. After 15 years of fruitlessly seeking a way to lift the spell, Oscar resorts to enlisting the help of a different witch. To this end, he heads to the Azure Tower, home of the Witch of the Azure Moon. Ascending the tower is no easy task; for decades, no one has overcome the array of traps, puzzles, and enemies designed to repulse any challengers. Oscar, however, easily climbs to the top, where he meets the fabled witch, Tinasha. To the prince's surprise, despite being hundreds of years old, Tinasha looks like a beautiful young woman in her late teens.\n\nOscar explains his circumstances to the witch, who quickly perceives the true nature of his affliction. Though she claims that undoing the spell would be tremendously difficult, Tinasha proposes a workaround—to find Oscar a partner capable of withstanding the curse's effects.\n\nRealizing that such a woman is right in front of his eyes, Oscar boldly tells the witch to marry him. Though he is promptly rejected, the young prince refuses to back down, and the two eventually reach an agreement: Tinasha will leave the tower and live with Oscar for the next year. As the two continue searching for a way to lift Oscar's curse, word of Tinasha's emergence from isolation spreads, catching the attention of all sorts of old acquaintances.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Taiyou is swept away by a stranger and eventually awakens to Mutsumi, who introduces him to her siblings—a family of spies who harbor superhuman abilities. Every generation produces one ordinary human who becomes the family head. Mutsumi is one of these, and the family's mission is to protect her with their lives. \n\nThe vice principal's real name is Kyoichiro Yozakura, and he is the eldest son of the family. As Kyouichiro believes that Taiyou is a threat to Mutsumi's life, the only way to keep both Taiyou and Mutsumi safe is for them to get married; the family has a rule that prevents them from killing within the Yozakura household. Though at first reluctant, Taiyou agrees in order to protect Mutsumi. Now he must train as a Yozakura spy to ward off the constant threats on the lives of both Mutsumi and himself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thanks to his noble status, the 13-year-old Ciel is swiftly able to enroll as a student, while his devilish butler Sebastian Michaelis assumes a teaching position at the school. \n\nCiel does not anticipate being unable to locate the Queen's relative on campus. To make matters worse, he cannot request a meeting with the headmaster of the college, who may be the only person that knows anything pertaining to the disappearance. The only ones in frequent contact with the headmaster are the heads of the college dormitories, known as the Prefect 4 (P4): Edgar Redmond, Lawrence Bluewer, Herman Greenhill, and Gregory Violet.\n\nCiel must concoct a plan to get in the P4's good graces if he wants to use their connections to succeed in his mission. But the distinguished college and its students hide much that is unseen, making this task more improbable than he could imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a year of waiting, she meets Fay Theo Philus, an apostle—a human granted a supernatural ability called an Arise and thus given permission to challenge the gods in games. Fay and Leoleshea realize they share a passion for games, whether it be with cards or a battle of wits with a god. Declaring that she likes this human, Leoleshea allows Fay to call her \"Leshea\" and team up with her to play in the gods' games.\n\nEver since the gods gave humans the ability to challenge them, they have promised to grant any wish after ten victories. Leshea desires to become an official god again, as she previously descended to the human world and lost her status as a divine being. Fay has only one goal: to find the woman who long ago taught him how to play games. \n\nThough Leshea and Fay quickly prove themselves to be a capable team, the gods will not allow them ten victories so easily: every game has its own unique conditions and hidden rules. Together, the duo will have to act as a perfect team to finally achieve their goals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Accompanied by his driver who assumes the identity of his sister, Fable is bound by a special condition: he must act as a civilian and not murder anyone lest he and his partner lose their lives.\n\nHowever, the seemingly well-deserved holiday soon takes a grim turn. Takeshi Ebihara, the second-in-command of the Osaka mafia that officially protects the assassin, sees Fable's presence as a threat and wants to remove him. Constantly monitored by the yakuza and regularly put in life-or-death situations, Fable has no other choice but to outwit Takeshi's schemes if he wants to stay alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Hobin only manages to stay strong by reminding himself that he needs to work hard to support his hospitalized mother. However, during his classmate Woo Jihyeok's live stream, Hobin completely snaps after a humiliating incident. As a result, the two men engage in a grotesque fistfight that lasts until dawn.\n\nThe following day, Hobin discovers that the livestream of his fight went viral on NewTube, turning him into a celebrity overnight. After he realizes that making viral videos is a very lucrative endeavor, Hobin agrees to team up with Jihyeok to create a channel that features his martial prowess. However, Hobin needs to become a seasoned fighter and keep his distance from those who seek to use him for his newfound fame, unless he wants a lack of views to become the least of his problems. Thankfully for him, the unexpected discovery of a series of obscure self-learning videos might be just what he needs to survive in the content creation industry.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From drastic changes to the terrain to bizarre mutations among people, the way of life is overwritten with new rules. The town of Agano is one of the few remaining settlements, and its citizens aged 21 and above have transformed into animals.\n\nShizuru Chikura, a high school student from Agano, is desperately searching for her friend, Youka Nakatomi. Coming across a picture in a newspaper placing Youka in Ikebukuro, Shizuru starts packing for a trip. But with public transportation effectively shut down, her options are limited. Fortunately, Tairo Zenjirou, a senile old conductor and the only human adult in town, comes to the rescue when he teaches her how to operate an abandoned train.\n\nWith her destination set, Shizuru ventures off on a journey to find her missing friend. On the day of departure, however, her other classmates—Nadeshiko Hoshi, Reimi Kuga, and Akira Shinonome—decide to tag along at the last minute as they embark on this one-track adventure that might expose them to dangers far surpassing anything they have encountered in Agano.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, the villain is a notoriously fearsome and powerful witch, who, enraged by the duke and his companions' trip back in time, torments them even from the afterlife. Moreover, an unexpected loved one reappears, strengthening the duke and Alice's hope to break the curse and finally close the distance between them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Experienced voice actor Yasumi Utatane works hard to maintain her image as a pure and innocent idol to please her fans, even as she struggles to find more jobs in the industry. But Yasumi has a secret—she is actually Yumiko Satou, a high school girl who prefers loose clothes and flashy jewelry, a complete contradiction to her false professional persona.\n\nAs Yasumi, Yumiko is finally offered an exciting opportunity to do a radio program alongside another up-and-coming voice actor she admires: Yuuhi Yuugure. In Yumiko’s eyes, Yuuhi’s cute looks and talented acting embody what a voice actor should be. As soon as they are introduced at the recording studio, however, Yumiko realizes that Yuuhi is actually her gloomy classmate, Chika Watanabe. Together, the pair commit to their radio program and slowly begin to open up. In supporting each other, Yumikoi and Chika gradually learn to be true to themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While the men plot over daily governance, women compete for the hand of Wakamiya, the crown prince who was selected as the Kinu, the servant to the Mountain God. Four young women arrive at the court to join the competition, including one named Asebi.\n\nWhile the kind and innocent Asebi sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the other women, the crown prince has to fight for his place in the clan. Despite being born both to a concubine and as a second son, the royal priests still chose Wakamiya to be the Kinu over his older brother. This decision created a rift between the siblings while enraging Wakamiya's stepmother in the process. \n\nWhen Yukiya, one of the teenage sons of the village chief, is sent to the palace to become Wakamiya's new attendant, the prince  is not pleased in the slightest. However, Yukiya's presence at the imperial courts is no mere coincidence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Luck is simply not on Mito's side; when he stumbles upon a cafe and cuts his hand, a strange server named Ruka Saotome licks the blood from his wound and even dramatically retches at its apparent disgusting taste. Offended and dispirited, Mito runs off to a bridge, hoping to put an end to his misery.\n\nBut when Mito accidentally slips, he is miraculously saved by Ruka, who reveals he is a vampire. Unable to drink blood from just any woman for mysterious reasons, Ruka proposes that Mito become his thrall—a vampire's human servant and primary source of food. In this deal, Ruka will shower Mito with love to sweeten his blood, and Mito will gain a warm place to call home.\n\nHowever, there is an issue: Mito is a girl! Concealing her long, flowing hair and feminine body, Mito readily takes this chance and enrolls in the Hijirigaoka Boys' High School while working part-time at the cafe with Ruka. But the more Mito's bond with Ruka deepens, the more she struggles to hide her secret.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Haruka Kiyomine and Kei Kaname were once recognized as the most formidable pitcher-catcher duo in middle school baseball. Known as the \"General,\" Kaname paired his expert strategies with Kiyomine's explosive pitches, crushing the dreams of many starry-eyed players who hoped to one day make it to the big leagues.\n\nHigh school freshman Tarou Yamada is one such former player. Having given up on competing, he enrolls in Kotesashi High School—a completely average public school with no baseball team to speak of—where he discovers that his new classmates are the legendary pair who once destroyed his dreams. Adding to this shocking revelation, he learns that amnesia has reduced the once level-headed General to a vulgar class clown. Having lost all interest in baseball, Kaname dragged a disappointed Kiyomine to Kotesashi simply because the school was close to where they live.\n\nAs Kotesashi forms a fledgling baseball club, Yamada meets other players he once admired who also left baseball behind. While they might be unwilling now, Yamada believes that if he can convince such talented athletes to start playing again, it might be possible to achieve their dreams and win the national championship—as long as they can put up with Kaname's incessant joking.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The couple's union was frowned upon by many due to Masaki's status as an omega—a secondary gender that allows an individual to give birth. Even for an alpha—seen as the superior secondary gender—such as Hiromu, discrimination seems to be commonplace and a hindrance to a life of domestic bliss.\n\nFortunately, the new family is not alone. Little Hikari becomes attached to Yuuki Hirai, the Fujiyoshis' lonely college student neighbor. Despite his initial reluctance, Yuuki ends up befriending the infant. Moreover, the family can also confide in Hiromu's childhood friend and coworker Tomohiro \"Matsu\" Matsuo.\n\nAlthough everything is going well for the young couple and their child, a sudden presence from the past might pose a problem for the peaceful life they dream of.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Salvatore is the king of the racing world.\n\nUnexpectedly entering the tournament is a former ballet dancer, Rin Rindou, who has been given a chance to become a real racer after setting a world record in a racing video game. Forced to give up dancing, Rin shifts her focus to chasing a new goal, despite her lack of experience. Making the most of her peculiar skill set and the NEX Race innovations, the young newcomer may just be the one to dethrone the absolute king.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Trying to move on in his life, former professional golfer Kazuyoshi Igarashi arrives at Hinoshima Island for a job at its development center. Expecting the island to be a very rural area with nothing much to offer, Kazuyoshi cannot hide his amazement when he discovers a complete golf course made by the island's inhabitants. Using the seaside terrain to their advantage, the people there have adopted golfing as their hobby.\n\nTo add to his surprise, Kazuyoshi meets a young girl named Tonbo Ooi, who has been playing golf using only a 3-iron—a notoriously difficult-to-use club. As the former pro gets more involved with Tonbo and witnesses her seemingly impossible shots, he begins to see golf in a whole new light, rediscovering how fun the sport can actually be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Himari has grown to be incredibly shy, and she has all but given up on her dream.\n\nBoth girls enroll as first years at Paradise Private Academy. On the first day of school, Himari gets lost on her way back to the dormitory and stumbles upon a room radiating a pink light. She falls into the room, and a bracelet clasps onto her wrist, transporting her to the AiPriVerse—the world where AiPris perform.\n\nHimari accidentally enters the newcomer auditions for the AiPriVerse, and her performance impresses Paradise Academy's Student Council. They offer to become her producers, with the condition that she will conceal her status as an AiPri. Little does Himari know that Mitsuki herself is also an AiPri and has been hiding it from her! Their childhood dream of performing together gradually comes to fruition—even as the academy's principal threatens to ban AiPri from school grounds entirely.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
