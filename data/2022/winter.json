Under the guidance of the Beast Titan, Zeke, Eren takes extreme measures to end the ancient conflict between Marley and Eldia—but his true intentions remain a mystery. Delving deep into his family's past, Eren fights to control his own destiny.\n\nMeanwhile, the long-feuding nations of Marley and Eldia utilize both soldiers and Titans in a brutal race to eliminate the other. Reiner Braun uses his own powers in a desperate bid to hold off Eren's own militaristic force, and his fellow Eldians—children Falco Grice and Gabi Braun—struggle to survive in the unfolding chaos.\n\nElsewhere, Eren's childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert remain imprisoned alongside Eren's former Survey Corps companions, all disturbed by Eren's monstrous transformation. Under the blind belief that Eren still secretly harbors good intentions, Mikasa and the others enter the fray in an attempt to save their friend's very soul.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Nonetheless, he goes to great lengths to keep his unique hobby a secret, as he believes that he would be ridiculed were it revealed. \n\nEnter Marin Kitagawa, an extraordinarily pretty girl whose confidence and poise are in stark contrast to Gojou's meekness. It would defy common sense for the friendless Gojou to mix with the likes of Kitagawa, who is always surrounded by her peers. However, the unimaginable happens when Kitagawa discovers Gojou's prowess with a sewing machine and brightly confesses to him about her own hobby: cosplay. Because her sewing skills are pitiable, she decides to enlist his help.\n\nAs Gojou and Kitagawa work together on one cosplay outfit after another, they cannot help but grow close—even though their lives are worlds apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a battle against the gigantic wolf and a vampire hunter, Vanitas decides to team up with Jeanne in order to find Noé. Despite being allies, Jeanne's goal is the opposite of Vanitas', as she was tasked to kill the Beast—suspecting it may be someone she used to know.\n\nMeanwhile, a severely wounded Noé is picked up by the mysterious Chloé d'Apchier and her servant. Like Noé, Chloé is a vampire whose existence was erased from the public's knowledge. She has been a guardian for future generations and once tried to find a way to become human again. While Noé is grateful to Chloé for her hospitality, little does he know that she might be siding with forces far more dangerous than the Beast itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "At birth, mages randomly acquire one of the four \"crests\" that represents the extent of their magical capability. Equipped with a crest specializing in creation, a man named Gaius reached the ceiling of his potential, becoming known as the world's strongest sage. Despite his overwhelming power, he is unsatisfied with his abilities and desires to possess the mark suitable for close combat. Knowing that a person's crest is unchangeable, Gaius decides to reincarnate far into the future, hoping to alter his fate.\n\nThousands of years later, Gaius is reborn as Mathias Hildesheimer, successfully obtaining his long-coveted crest. However, he is surprised to learn that in these times, magic has vastly waned, and the techniques that were once widely used are now nothing more than just a speck of legend. Moreover, the crest that he painstakingly strived to attain is now considered the weakest—merely dubbed the \"Crest of Failure.\"\n\nNevertheless, Mathias naturally exceeds all expectations. He enrolls into the royal capital's Second Academy, acing every trial that comes his way. But soon after, Mathias discovers the dark truth behind humanity's downfall into magical mediocrity—demons—and endeavors to remedy the consequence of his millennia-long absence once and for all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Reito Mizuhara is a medical student at the National Advanced Medical School in Tokyo who contracts a rare, lethal disease called cellular sclerosis. In order to be treated, he is put into cryogenic sleep for five years. Upon awakening, he learns that a year into his slumber, a worldwide pandemic broke out, caused by the novel Male Killer (MK) virus which exclusively afflicts males and has killed all other men on Earth. \n\nFortunately, Reito and four other men were spared during their cryosleep and are now immune to the virus. As the only men left in the world, they are thus tasked with mating with as many women as possible to repopulate the planet. However, Reito is committed to his childhood friend and sole love interest, Elisa Tachibana—only to learn that she went missing three years ago. While the other male survivors adapt accordingly to this new world, Reito instead chooses to pursue Elisa, fight never-ending temptation, and investigate this mysterious virus. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

According to the government, the horrific state of the new world is the result of mushroom spores being spread by the likes of Bisco Akaboshi, labeled the \"Man-Eating Mushroom.\"\n\nBut Bisco would beg to differ. In reality, he is a \"Mushroom Protector,\" determined to uncover the legendary \"Sabikui\" mushroom—said to be the ultimate cure for the rusting disease. Joining him on his quest are his giant crab Akutagawa and the kind doctor Milo Nekoyanagi, who is actively searching for a rust poisoning treatment for his sick sister. Despite the prejudice aimed toward him by the common folk, Bisco refuses to give up on his quest to purify the rotting world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Sasaki saves Miyano's classmate from a group of bullies, and after that, Miyano cannot seem to shake off his eccentric upperclassman. His silent admiration for Sasaki gradually sours into annoyance each time the so-called delinquent refuses to leave him alone. Constantly being called by cute nicknames and having his boundaries ignored, Miyano wonders why Sasaki wants to get close to him.\n\nThe shy and easily flustered Miyano harbors an embarrassing secret—he is a \"fudanshi,\" a boy who likes boys' love (BL) manga. The last thing he wants is for other students to find out, but through a slip of the tongue, he reveals the truth to Sasaki. Intrigued, the clueless Sasaki asks to borrow a book to read, which he is given very reluctantly. To Miyano's surprise, Sasaki enjoys the BL that he receives and asks for more, marking a shift in their strange dynamic.\n\nAlthough Sasaki appears to possess some personal agenda, his feelings for Miyano become complicated the more time they spend together. As they now share a common interest, their relationship is poised to change and further develop.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "With a dignified veteran's body and a long white beard, summoner mage Dunbalf was one of the strongest player characters in the virtual reality online multiplayer roleplaying game Ark Earth Online, even heralded as a one-man army. Together with the \"Nine Wise Mages\" and King Solomon, they formed the mage player Kingdom of Alcait. But one day, Dunbalf and the other Nine Wise Mages suddenly go missing, leaving no trace behind.\n\nIn an effort to spend his expiring credits, Dunbalf had purchased a cosmetic kit and tinkered with his character; however, he accidentally fell asleep during the customization process. Upon waking up, Dunbalf not only notices that the world of Ark Earth Online has become more realistic, but also discovers that he has turned into a cute girl! After reaching Alcait, he learns it has been 30 years since he supposedly disappeared.\n\nNow tasked with finding the other missing mages by King Solomon, the avid role player proclaims his new identity as Mira—the Pupil of the Wise Man Dunbalf—and ventures forth to prove his legacy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Hiding his true opinion from his peers and growing distant from his childhood friend Kojirou Kanemaki, Musashi lives in angst until the day of his graduation.\n\nWhen the fresh graduates arrive at the mine, they are horrified to see the inhumane treatment of miners and the uncanny physical appearance of their overseers. However, Musashi manages to endure thanks to Kojirou's help. As the demon leader wreaks havoc on the quarry, Musashi is saved once more from certain death by the Takeda samurai clan. Recovering from humiliation and yearning for adventure, Musashi embarks on a journey to become a samurai and form his own clan!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When a young girl, gifted with an odd eye that allows her to see the future, foolishly disrespects the clan, her father pays the price of her crime with his life. Soon after, as fate would have it, Taira no Shigemori—the eldest son of the clan leader—stumbles upon the same unfortunate girl, who now calls herself \"Biwa.\" Biwa informs him that the downfall of the Heike is imminent. After learning of the great injustice Biwa suffered at the Heike's hands, Shigemori vows to take her in and care for her rather than let her be killed.\n\nIn an era of rising military tension, the Heike are in the midst of a cunning struggle for power, and bloodstained war is on the horizon. Shigemori, whose eyes allow him to see spirits of the dead, is both anxious and hopeful to prevent his clan's demise. Biwa, however, is reluctant to reveal the future to him and must adapt to her new life filled with both happiness and sorrow in this pivotal chapter in Japanese history.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Bewildered to hear Asami's voice, the three friends are shown images of the future and asked to choose between two grim alternatives. Refusing to be bound by predetermined outcomes, the three tackle this troubling event head-on, marking the beginning of a series of cruel dilemmas that they will have to overcome in order to protect the 24th Ward and its people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, beneath such an exterior lies a monumental secret: Agastia is one of various highly advanced evil organizations that aim for world domination. Despite its true nature, the company boasts enticements that make it worthwhile to put up with the work environment. Led by its great leader Akashic, Agastia has recently become a frontrunner in reaching its fellow groups' common goal.\n\nWorking for Agastia's Monster Development Division, Touka Kuroitsu is a researcher who primarily does fieldwork due to the eccentricities of her seniors. Kuroitsu's everyday jobs also include giving abrupt presentations and proposals, meeting ridiculous expectations for monster designs, and accompanying said monsters to face inevitable defeat by Agastia's enemies. Nevertheless, nothing will stop Kuroitsu from doing her best if it means getting the promotion she desires!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Disheartened by the hostile treatment, she decides to submit a letter of resignation after just a few months of employment.\n\nBut on the same day Mai chooses to quit, she meets Seiko Fuji—the former ace of the Criminal Affairs Division who is assigned as her new instructor.

While they are physically superior to flesh-and-blood fighters, T-Dolls are incapable of formulating complex plans and thus require a human commander to issue orders.\n\nSangvis Ferri was an industry-leading T-Doll manufacturer until they attempted to install a specialized T-Doll as the company's sole commander—resulting in the immediate deaths of everyone at that facility. Seizing control of Sangvis factories, the rogue AI declared war on the remnants of mankind. Now facing a hostile robot invasion, Griffin &amp; Kryuger is the only paramilitary organization strong enough to withstand confrontation and halt their destructive advances.\n\nInvestigating the events related to Sangvis Ferri's aggression, the elite task force \"Team Anti-Rain\" searches for highly confidential information in an abandoned warehouse, but they are shortly ambushed. Hoping to safeguard their findings, the group temporarily disbands and each Doll goes into hiding. Meanwhile, the lazy but gifted Gentiane is hired by Griffin as a rookie commander and given her critical first mission—track down Team Anti-Rain and recover the classified data before Sangvis Ferri can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From players using extendable bats to pitchers wearing special equipment, Extreme Baseball is a futuristic version of the sport with modified rules, less restrictions, and bizarre applications of technology.\n\nWhen a group of youngsters bullies spineless Haru Shirokane, he is saved by an unexpected pair: Shun Kamiya and Taiga. As it turns out, Shun is a star player of Extreme Baseball who leads the Minato Tribe, the top-ranked team in Minato City. Meanwhile, Taiga aims to defeat Shun in hopes of becoming the strongest in the sport. In a string of spontaneous events that allow Shun to discover their potential, Taiga and Haru are roped into joining the Minato Tribe.\n\nAs the tribes across Minato City face a new threat led by the mysterious Oujirou Otori, the Minato Tribe might just need the power of their two new rookies to overcome the clutches of evil.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Getting ambushed by rogue demons on the road is business as usual for the Sanzou party. But when their latest assailants turn out to be humans, the group is left dumbfounded. The mystery only deepens when they encounter a wandering priest, Hazel Grouse, and his imposing bodyguard, Gaty Nene Hawk. The pair hails from the far West, with Hazel using his powers of resurrection to aid grief-stricken villages. While his ability is greatly welcomed by the people, the truth behind it is less miraculous than it seems. Furthermore, the resurrected humans gain golden eyes, a trait they share with the group's recent attackers. It appears that the friendly priest's intentions are not as generous as one might expect—and the Sanzou party is a step away from unraveling them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
