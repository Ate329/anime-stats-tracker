    "synopsis": "After his father's death and the destruction of his village at the hands of English raiders, Einar wishes for a peaceful life with his family on their newly rebuilt farms. However, fate has other plans: his village is invaded once again. Einar watches helplessly as the marauding Danes burn his lands and slaughter his family. The invaders capture Einar and take him back to Denmark as a slave. \n\nEinar clings to his mother's final words to survive. He is purchased by Ketil, a kind slave owner and landlord who promises that Einar can regain his freedom in return for working in the fields. Soon, Einar encounters his new partner in farm cultivation—Thorfinn, a dejected and melancholic slave. As Einar and Thorfinn work together toward their freedom, they are haunted by both sins of the past and the ploys of the present. Yet they carry on, grasping for a glimmer of hope, redemption, and peace in a world that is nothing but unjust and unforgiving.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The only issue is that the tomboyish Tomo is in love with Jun, but he regards her like a brother.\n\nAt the start of their first year of high school, Tomo confesses her feelings to Jun. However, her rough mannerisms and lack of hesitance to throw a punch do nothing to sway Jun's heart. Realizing that he will remain indifferent to her affections unless she does something about it, Tomo must find a way to knock some sense into Jun and open his eyes to what is right in front of him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The adult Takemichi grapples with grief and the ramifications of the Tokyo Manji gang's criminal empire—an unintended product of his timeline meddling. Though the gang once operated under the idealistic Manjirou \"Mikey\" Sano, it has now been taken over by the malicious Tetta Kisaki and, as a result, has abandoned its original optimistic intent.\n\nDespite feeling hopeless, Takemichi travels to the past once again to investigate Black Dragon, a rival motorcycle gang whose actions ultimately lead to Hinata's demise. There, he meets the young Hakkai Shiba, a fellow gang member whose older brother, Taiju, tyrannically rules Black Dragon. When Taiju brutally beats Takemichi in a one-sided street brawl, Hakkai attempts to withdraw from Tokyo Manji in apology—an act that Takemichi must prevent to spare Hakkai a grim future.\n\nThrough a shared tragedy, Takemichi bonds with Chifuyu Matsuno, establishing a close comradery both boys desperately need. With Chifuyu on his side, Takemichi works to unravel the fates of Black Dragon's members, fighting to create a happy future for his loved ones.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Shiina lives in an entirely different world from Amane Fujimiya, her next-door neighbor. Despite living so close together, they have never spoken once. But their silence is broken when Fujimiya spots Shiina gloomily sitting on a swing amidst a heavy rainstorm and lends her his umbrella. \n\nWhen Fujimiya catches a cold the next day, Shiina wishes to return the favor for the umbrella by nursing him back to health. Believing that this would be their first and last interaction, he silently appreciates her kindness. However, Shiina—who cannot help but worry about Fujimiya's lack of tidiness and proper nutrition—begins to cook and clean for him. As the unlikely pair spend time together in Fujimiya's apartment, they explore the true nature of their relationship and the gentle emotions that emerge from it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The bright lights and merry atmosphere guide Miri to a big hotel and a man with a delicious-looking cake. However, the child has just unknowingly walked into the center of an elaborate, foolproof plan for assassinating a dangerous mafia boss.\n\nProfessional assassins Kazuki Kurusu and Rei Suwa live together, fleeing memories of their grim childhoods and avoiding emotional connections. When their mission goes awry and they end up bringing Miri home, there is only one reasonable thing to do: return Miri to her mother. But the girl's innocent laugh and pure worldview quickly enamor her to Kazuki, who secretly enjoys playing a parent, and it is not long before Rei's impenetrable heart makes room for Miri.\n\nMiri's every move is unpredictable, and Kazuki and Rei find raising an energetic child harder than any of their missions. Although it presents a great risk to their careers, Kazuki and Rei—both assuming the affectionate nickname \"papa\"—decide to provide Miri with a normal childhood despite all the odds stacked against them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although he is always on edge, Naoto no longer seems to mind Nagatoro's presence. Time and again, Naoto demonstrates his hidden, cool demeanor, and Nagatoro displays her possessive tendencies. However, they still can not seem to completely close the distance between them. It is clear to everyone else that the pair have feelings for each other.\n\nFor Nagatoro, there is nothing more entertaining than toying with Naoto. But as the girl shows no plans to stop teasing her senpai, it is only a matter of time before they realize how they truly feel.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With this ability, Mukouda is able to cheaply purchase food products and utensils from Japan—most of which are considered luxuries in this world. As Mukouda cooks up a storm using his ability, he catches the eye of the fearsome mythical wolf Fel. The legendary beast swiftly negotiates a contract to become Mukouda's familiar, unable to resist the delicious dishes. With Fel by his side, Mukouda travels the world, earning his keep as an adventurer and merchant all the while enjoying delectable meals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As it turns out, Fuyutsuki-san is his new coworker.\n\nAt the office, the cool-headed Fuyutsuki-san offers simple and rational solutions to Himuro-kun's icy dilemmas—everything from helping him garden without freezing his plants to ensuring he does not melt during their tropical work retreat.

Even though Fuyutsuki-san is unfamiliar with love, Himuro-kun remains determined to repay her kindness and warm her heart in any way he can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Junta Shiraishi is a high school student with one simple goal—to enjoy his youth. However, achieving this goal is not so straightforward since Shiraishi is effectively invisible to his peers; even his teachers routinely fail to notice his presence. In fact, there is a rumor circulating that whoever manages to spot him will receive good luck. \n\nBut there is one person who notices Shiraishi's presence without fail. Seated right next to him, Nagisa Kubo is determined not to let him quietly fade into the background. Unfortunately for him, this means that Shiraishi finds himself in some peculiar situations, all orchestrated by Kubo. Despite this, Kubo's playful antics might just be the catalyst needed to spark the thrilling youth that Shiraishi longs for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Also at odds with her goal is the fact that Anis is incapable of using magic despite her noble status. Refusing to give up so easily, she renounces her right to the throne, and focuses on developing \"magicology\" by combining various resources with knowledge from her previous life on Earth.\n\nDue to Anis' nature, responsibility for the kingdom's future is passed onto her younger brother, Algard. Pushed into a political marriage with Euphyllia Magenta, a girl he hardly knows, Algard rebels by spending more time with a commoner girl than his fiancée. After Euphyllia tries to intervene, Algard publicly calls off their marriage and denounces his ex-fiancée as a bully.\n\nAfter crashing into the banquet where Algard makes the announcement, Anis rescues Euphyllia on the flying broom she is testing. She decides to make Euphyllia her assistant, which the other girl reluctantly agrees to. Although their partnership appears random at first, Anis has an ulterior motive for wanting Euphyllia's company.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But the man they find near the desolate town of Jeneora Rock is a far cry from the lethal terrorist they expect. In reality, Vash is a passive and carefree drifter; he is a proponent of peace, beloved by the residents of the town. His inaccurate reputation actually stems from the widespread atrocities committed by his twin brother Millions Knives. Still, Vash is dubbed \"The Humanoid Typhoon'' due to the tendency for violent chaos to follow in his wake.\n\nChaos soon arrives in the form of bounty hunters seeking the high price on Vash's head, and their violent pursuit poses great danger to the town and its precious power plant. Thanks to his gunslinging prowess, Vash is able to resist most of these nefarious forces. Yet he must soon face off against the ultimate evil: the unstoppable destructive power of his malevolent brother.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While their stories are utterly different, there is one common thread: betrayal. Each of the four, having been bitterly betrayed by someone they treasured, has developed a deep-seated distrust of humanity.\n\nBut in addition to their similar worldviews, the four have one more commonality: a critical lack of funds. Realizing that things cannot continue as they are, they decide to form a party, rank up, and make as much money as possible to spend on their respective hobbies. What these disillusioned adventurers do not know, however, is that they will one day save the world from unfathomable peril.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But when his company collapses and his wife cheats on him, Masayuki retreats to the city where Yuki-Onna once saved him, and he reconnects with her by offering her money and tasty meals. While Masayuki recovers from his misfortunes, another one knocks on his door: his ex-wife is found beaten to death, and now only Yuki-Onna—who cannot reveal herself—can corroborate his alibi.\n\nWith no one to turn to, Yuki-Onna enlists the help of the spirits' God of Wisdom, Kotoko Iwanaga. Revered by the various spirits that wander the earth, Kotoko uses her extraordinary wits and cunning to solve all quarrels they may have. In her duty to protect spirits and humans from colliding, Kotoko drags along her immortal boyfriend, Kurou Sakuragawa, and promises to prove Masayuki's innocence without exposing Yuki-Onna's existence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After Dariel intervenes to help Malika, she invites him to stay at her village in return. There, he discovers that the reason he has zero suitability for magic as a demon is that he is, in fact, a human.\n\nHowever, Dariel is no ordinary human. Possessing potential that far outweighs even heroes, Dariel may soon find himself involved in the humans and demons' seemingly never-ending conflict, facing against the race he once considered allies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This depraved lifestyle causes his prodigious sister, Mihari, to worry about his well-being. In hopes of solving this problem, she devises a plan to rehabilitate him back to normalcy.\n\nThe first part of Mihari's plan is to concoct a medicine that changes her brother's biological constitution into a bona fide female, much to Mahiro's vehement dismay. Stuck in this predicament, Mahiro has no choice but to live out his life as a cute girl until the effect wears off—if it ever does.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To award him for his honorable achievements, the goddess Alistia appears and grants him one wish. Having never been able to master the blade, Inglis asks to be reincarnated in order to do so.\n\nIn a blink of an eye, Inglis finds himself born in the far future as a daughter of the Eucus noble family. Six years later, Inglis is discovered to be Runeless—incapable of utilizing the runes that enable the use of magic in this era. She is therefore ineligible to become a knight. However, this fits in well with Inglis' plan: she instead decides to become the squire for her cousin, Rafinha Bilford, allowing Inglis to focus on pushing her limits.\n\nFor Inglis, the challenges this familiar yet different world has to offer are instead opportunities for her to hone her skills—and possibly become an extraordinary squire in the process.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Taking advantage of this, humans enslaved fairies, but 15-year-old Ann Halford longs to see the day when fairies and humans are treated as equals.\n\nThe aspiring confectioner dreams of becoming a Silver Sugar Master just like her late mother. In order to achieve this lofty goal, Ann sets out for the capital of Lewiston, home to the annual Royal Candy Fair. However, to be bestowed the elusive title, Ann's confection crafted from silver sugar must be recognized with a royal medal at the event.\n\nAnn hires a sharp-tongued warrior fairy, Shall Fen Shall, to be her bodyguard for the perilous journey ahead. After saving him from his cruel fairy trader, she promises to return Shall's wing to him once they reach the capital, much to his confusion. But as the pair travel further along, the time they spend together grows, and they learn more about each other and their true desires.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His abilities catch the attention of Barnabus Ablitt, the principal of the Barbador Academy of Magic, who invites Seiichi to become a teacher at the institution. Coincidentally, Seiichi's classmates from Earth are enrolled there, which will lead to an awkward reunion if he is to meet them.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, an enigmatic cult called The Great Devil Order devises a sinister scheme to resurrect their deity and sacrifice the students of Barbador to hasten the process. As Seiichi's power is second to none, it is up to him to protect not only his friends but also the entire world from the looming darkness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After failing to enter her university of choice and losing her entire family in an accident, she finds herself plummeting off a cliff due to an especially fragile guardrail. Through what seems to be the only bit of the fortune left in her life, Mitsuha's firm unwillingness to die allows her to be transported to another world, where she ends up surviving.\n\nIn this foreign land, Mitsuha wanders around for days before collapsing from exhaustion and being rescued by a little girl named Colette. Not long after, she finds herself in yet another life-threatening situation, and her indomitable will shines once more, granting her an audience with a divine cosmic being. The entity reveals to Mitsuha that she has acquired not only superhuman regeneration but also the ability to transport between worlds at will.\n\nArmed with this new information, Mitsuha brainstorms ways to utilize her newfound power to its full potential. Realizing that she can take goods from Earth and resell them to the other world at a higher price, she resolves to save up eighty thousand gold coins to be able to retire comfortably.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Contrary to her rude remarks toward Fiene, Lieselotte longs to be her friend. Lieselotte is also deeply in love with her own fiancé, Prince Siegwald Fitzenhagen—the game's main love interest. Unfortunately, in almost every route, Lieselotte is doomed to a tragic end.\n\nKobayashi manages to convince Endou to play MagiKoi to practice his speaking skills. What begins as a normal playthrough turns extraordinary when Siegwald suddenly hears the players' voices inside the game! Now labeled as \"gods,\" Endou and Kobayashi use their comments and analyses to save their beloved tsundere villainess from her fated demise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In his pursuit, he is aided by self-proclaimed merchant-of-all-trades Yuuen Usui, who is actually one of the Revengers—assassins who seek justice for the wronged and dispense bloody revenge on their behalf.\n\nTragedy seems destined to follow Raizou as he becomes increasingly intertwined with members of the Revengers. As he begins working as a vigilante alongside them, the complicated web between the corrupt Japanese political elite, the unscrupulous Europeans, and the Revengers gradually reveals itself. The more entangled he becomes in these affairs, the more Raizou realizes that justice is as deceptive as the honor that he sought to redeem.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Exorcist ninjas are tasked with protecting people from these spiteful spirits.\n\nMatsuri Kazamaki is a young exorcist ninja born to a prestigious clan. His childhood friend, Suzu Kanade, is an ayakashi medium—an individual with immense vitality that attracts ayakashi. Matsuri deems all ayakashi threatening and wishes to keep Suzu as far from them as possible, but this clashes with her desire to remain close to them. One day, the pair encounters Shirogane, the \"King of Ayakashi,\" who is hellbent on consuming Suzu. As she is about to be eaten, Matsuri comes to the rescue and manages to seal the ayakashi's powers—but not before Shirogane takes revenge by turning him into a girl!\n\nUntil he finds a way to transform back, Matsuri must adjust to his new, peculiar lifestyle while fighting against hostile ayakashi. Moreover, Suzu is now conflicted about her feelings toward Matsuri—further plunging their relationship into a state of ambiguity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Once she reaches the Canopy—an area that appears to be an infinite window of transparent ice—she meets Kaina, one of the last men alive on the Canopy. However, she can not find the man she was looking for.\n\nUnable to return by herself to her country, the princess finds a helping hand in Kaina, who is eager to explore the surface world that he thought was empty.

    "synopsis": "Human civilization no longer revolves around fire, but is instead now driven by fear of it. Repeated wars have changed human biology, and people now spontaneously combust when they get close to natural flame. However, a new source of energy prevents society from complete collapse: a stone-shaped material used to produce light and steam lies within the bodies of monsters that infest numerous forests. Those tasked with collecting this precious resource are called fire hunters.\n\nTouko, a young village girl, is saved from a forest monster by a fire hunter who perishes during his heroic action. After the hunter's dog, Kanata, heals from his own injury, the girl's family sends her to the capital in order to return Kanata and the hunter's fire sickle to his relatives.\n\nElsewhere, the fire hunter's son, Koushi, and his sister are adopted by a wealthy family. Koushi learns some troubling facts related to the country's ruling royal family. He conducts secret research on a special fire stone found by his late father, kickstarting a race against time between the country's leaders and those trying to save mankind from its ultimate demise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Those tasked with fighting them are Paladins, who utilize the destructive power of Clerics: beings gifted with uncontrollable magical powers.\n\nWhile mourning the death of his war partner, former Paladin Jiiro crosses paths with Kuumi, a young woman who has just awakened her magical powers. After the pair form a contract to save the city from a giant beast attack, Jiiro learns that Kuumi has escaped a laboratory and is being hunted by the underlings of Mezami, the head of the research facility.\n\nReluctantly agreeing to help Kuumi flee from her pursuers, Jiiro starts traveling with his new partner and her friend Myaa, a young girl with a cat headdress. As the unlikely trio wanders the Arsian lands, top officials begin setting their plans into motion—and the group of adventurers soon discover that men are to be feared more than monsters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Michi claims that a well-spent youth should be associated with things such as getting a boyfriend rather than sweaty tatami mats.\n\nHowever, Michi's plan to end her fledgling judo career with a bang is spoiled after experiencing an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the talented Towa Hiura. Later, her plan is further derailed when she finds out that Towa has enrolled in the same high school as herself and Sanae. With the sudden appearance of her past foe, Michi may soon realize that she still has lingering feelings for the sport of judo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Due to rising sea levels and a rapidly declining human population, androids have been engineered to perform most menial tasks, allowing humans to focus on other things. Aside from providing manual labor and customer service, androids also entertain humans through Babel—a tower where participants captivate audiences with song and dance to clear Climb Stages. The higher the climb, the more prize money is awarded.\n\nAndroids Cobalt, Chrom, Neon, and Kei are down on their luck and about to have their electricity cut off from unpaid bills. Desperate to make a quick buck, the group decide to become Babel climbers. However, winning the audience's favor is a great challenge. Dejected but unwilling to give up, Cobalt resolves to somehow improve their chances after watching an impressive performance by STAND-ALONE—the top climber unit.\n\nWhen the group stumbles across a mysterious choreographer willing to give away his routine, Cobalt sees this as their only way up. With the help of their human companion, Esora Shibaura, the androids form the unit KNoCC to tackle the daunting climb to the top of Babel, but they must also overcome android-based discrimination along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
