    "synopsis": "Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is a self-absorbed mage in a world of wands, cloaks, and royalty. Although she studies at Tristain Academy, a prestigious school for magicians, she has a major problem: Louise is unable to cast magic properly, earning her the nickname of \"Louise the Zero\" from her classmates.\n\nWhen the first year students are required to perform a summoning ritual, Louise's summoning results in a catastrophic explosion! Everyone deems this to be yet another failure, but when the smoke clears, a boy named Saito Hiraga appears. Now Louise's familiar, Saito is treated as a slave, forced to clean her clothes and eat off the ground. But when an unfamiliar brand is found etched on Saito's hand from the summoning ritual, it is believed to be the mark of a powerful familiar named Gandalfr.\n\nWild, adventurous, and explosive, Zero no Tsukaima follows Saito as he comes to terms with his new life and as Louise proves that there is more to her than her nickname suggests.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In his isolation, he has come to believe in many obscure conspiracy theories, but there is one in particular which he holds unshakable faith in: the theory that the evil conspirator behind his shut-in NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) status is the Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai (NHK)—an evil and secret organization dedicated to fostering the spread of hikikomori culture.\n\nNHK ni Youkoso! is a psychological dramedy that follows Tatsuhiro as he strives to escape from the NHK's wicked machinations and the disease of self-wrought isolation, while struggling to even just leave his apartment and find a job. His unexpected encounter with the mysterious Misaki Nakahara might signal a reversal of fortune for Tatsuhiro, but with this meeting comes the inevitable cost of having to face his greatest fear—society.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When several disappearances occur throughout Paris, the young knight believes that they are somehow connected to his sister's death. Hoping to find her killers, D'Eon joins the secret police to investigate the incidents.\n\nFollowing the clues, they piece together that a conspiracy between members of the French and Russian nobility, spurred on by a cult, may be behind the disappearances. D'Eon concludes that Lia may have uncovered the truth while on a mission and was killed as a result.\n\nThat night, the secret police are to arrest the Duke of Orléans on suspicion of being the mastermind. One of their own transforms into a demon called a Gargoyle and massacres the group. D'Eon attempts to rescue the sole survivor, only to find that he too has been transformed. During the ensuing battle, D'Eon is possessed by Lia's vengeful soul, who takes command of his body and slays the Gargoyle herself. In the aftermath, D'Eon must gather allies to discover the depth of this supernatural conspiracy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She soon desperately needs that protection: when she swallows a strange pink ball of what she believes to be hard candy, a huge number of people fall from the sky. The ball she swallowed is the Crystal Pearl, a symbolic trinket that magic users from another world fight over. The winner of the Crystal Pearl passes a magic exam that can grant them the prestigious title of professional wizards.\n\nZero and Ichii, two young men taking the exam together, quickly determine that the pearl is inside Nina and promise to protect her until the exam is over. With countless other examinees after the object, their task is daunting—but not as brutal as the embarrassment Nina faces when she arrives at school with two handsome boys at her heels.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Seemingly blessed with good and kind people around them, Kyou and Asu's lives are far from miserable. Above all else, the two sisters share a precious bond that, no matter what pain, trials, or quarrels may come their way, will always remain unbreakable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Years ago, extraterrestrials known as the Citizens of the Stars descended upon the planet of Tokinea and wreaked havoc on humanity. To fight back against them, the military developed the Majin project to create hybrids between humans and the Citizens of the Stars. With this combination of genes, they hope to exploit both the subservience of man and the powers of the alien.\n\nMajin no.7, a young girl kept under lock and key in a military base, is released after the Citizens of the Stars launch an attack. Despite possessing a plethora of abilities capable of effortlessly eliminating the enemy, she is burdened with doubt on the battlefield. However, when a boy named Yuuri tells her that she must fight to earn her freedom, Majin no. 7 is inspired by his courage and defeats the remaining Citizens of the Stars. The two decide to embark on a journey together, determined to find their calling in a time when humanity knows no peace.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
