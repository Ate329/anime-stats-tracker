However, there is no time to rest: Captain Akitaru Oubi is arrested by the military police under the influence of the White-Clad cult. Moreover, the White-Clad member Haumea—one of the eight pillars who possess Adolla Burst—has successfully brainwashed the leadership of the Tokyo Empire and infiltrated the heart of the firefighting organization. As a result, Shinra and the rest of the Company 8 squad are branded as rebels after they launch a rescue mission to save their captain and ultimately liberate Tokyo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In the year 2048, Dr. Deniz Skinner, a scientific genius dubbed second only to Einstein, developed the revolutionary painkiller Hapna. Being cheap with no reported side effects, the drug gained widespread acceptance, even though Skinner himself silently vanished one year after launching the drug. Everyone revelled in the heaven of relief and ecstasy provided by Hapna, but they would suddenly come crashing down to Earth. It is now 2052, and Skinner reappears, giving the shocking announcement that Hapna was designed to mutate into a lethal toxin, killing anyone who had consumed it. While he claims to have a cure, he will only hand it over if he is physically found within 30 days. \n\nAxel Gilberto, a maverick youngster serving a sentence of 888 years in a high-security prison, is unwillingly recruited by a group calling themselves Lazarus. Composed of eccentric misfits, the group has only one task—to find Skinner. With no means to escape and their lives on the line, Lazarus begins the hunt to find Skinner before the countdown to the end of humanity ends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While KEEL seems to be another rowdy group at first glance, their sudden appearance and strength in numbers might just be hiding a greater evil behind it.

    "synopsis": "In ancient times, some witches married their familiars, who had taken human form, giving birth to a lineage of ogres. One such ogre is Morihito Otogi, who while appearing completely human, still retains the inhuman strength of his bloodline. Nico Wakatsuki is a young witch and Morihito's childhood friend, but as part of her education, she had to go to the Witches' Holy Land to train and part ways with Morihito.\n\nYears later, just before Morihito's first year of high school, Nico returns home with one goal in mind: to claim him as her familiar. While most witches choose a cat or a bat, Nico has her heart set on Morihito in more ways than one. Although seemingly oblivious to her true feelings, Morihito and Nico end up living together under the same roof with both of Morihito's parents elsewhere. While reluctant at first, Morihito accepts his new role, determined to help Nico seamlessly fit back in with human society and protect her from fated disaster. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Many have become astounding swordsmen themselves, but Beryl remains quite humble, referring to himself as an old man. His former disciples all disagree, including Allucia Citrus, a girl who graduated from Beryl's training over 10 years ago and is currently the commander of the Royal Order of Knights.\n\nWishing to reveal her cherished teacher's true greatness, Allucia recommends Beryl to her superiors, leading to his appointment as a special instructor for the Order by imperial command. She delivers the news herself—though Beryl has yet to realize her deeper motive. Pressured by his aging parents, Beryl reluctantly accepts the job and moves to the capital. There, he meets more of his past students, such as Surena Lysandra, now a black-rank adventurer, and Ficelle Harbeller, a prominent member of the Magic Corps. Before long, word begins to spread: not even the strongest warriors can match the \"old man\" from the countryside.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thus, he is drawn to extra-legal, simpler work and takes on various local tasks beyond the grasp of the police and licensed heroes.\n\nHowever, a chance encounter with two misfits, a brash brawler vigilante who goes by Knuckleduster and the online sensation Pop☆Step, gives Kouichi the opportunity he has always dreamed about. With a dangerous new Quirk-enhancing drug turning ordinary people into instant villains, Kouichi finds himself accompanying the two in a quest to stop the drug from spreading. As the trio tries to get to the bottom of the case, the chaotic team looks to put a stop to wrongdoers that go overlooked by the law.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Though they have their differences, the two get along well enough to experience the joys of the walled city together.\n\nHowever, everything starts to fall apart when Kudou, half-asleep, suddenly kisses Kujirai—seemingly reciprocating the feelings she has yet to confess. But when Kudou explains that he had mistaken her for someone else, Kujirai finds herself drawn into a series of events that lead her to a past she cannot remember.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Mild-mannered Koushi Shirota is left utterly stunned when he witnesses the perfect student council president, Takane Takamine, ever so brazenly strip her panties off in front of the entire class after receiving an uncharacteristic test score of 98%. Even stranger, the imperfect score suddenly becomes a perfect 100% right before his eyes. Wanting to make sure what happened was not just a hallucination, he confronts her about it.\n\nSeemingly unbothered, Takamine reveals to him that she has an ability called Eternal Virgin Road, which allows her to undo any mistake she makes by taking off a piece of underwear, thus keeping up her prodigious facade. With Shirota being the only one aware of the truth, Takamine coerces him into becoming her closet—a carrier of spare panties—so that she can use Eternal Virgin Road as many times as she wants. With his already weak will being constantly put to the test, Shirota's life is flipped upside down as he finds himself too close for comfort with the unpredictable student council president. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The settlement was ruled by its shrine maiden, Itsukihime, whom only a select few were allowed to interact with. When Itsukihime passed away, Shirayuki was appointed in her place. Wishing to stay in contact with her, Jinta worked diligently for years and was finally selected as the next sentinel.\n\nAs the protector of the village, Jinta's duty is to eliminate any threats. One day, he encounters a demon in a nearby forest. At the end of the battle, the demon makes a proclamation about the destined ruler of all demonkind. He attaches his severed arm to Jinta, turning him into an unaging demon man. By the time Jinta comes to, Kadono is on fire. Suzune has transformed into the demon from the divination, and due to a series of misunderstandings, she murders Shirayuki and flees.\n\nDevastated, Jinta cannot forgive Suzune for her actions; he departs on a journey to find her. As Jinta travels around Japan across the eras, he endeavors to protect as many people as possible from aggressive demons.

During one such job, he meets Yulishia, an adventurer formerly employed by the royal family. Surprised by Kurt's impressive work, Yulishia discovers that he is no ordinary boy: Kurt possesses an astonishingly high aptitude in a variety of non-combat fields. Due to these talents, a court official tells Yulishia to offer Kurt a high status in the kingdom that would allow him to live in peace for the rest of his life.\n\nWhen Yulishia informs Kurt about his potential rank, he brushes off the offer, refusing to think of himself as above other people. Still unaware of his real power, Kurt continues taking as many odd jobs as possible, which might just make him a pivotal part of the kingdom before he even notices it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Meanwhile, the youngest, Mia, is not as extraordinary as her older sister but has charmed the entire country with her lovely personality. Despite their striking differences, Philia and Mia share an unbreakable bond.\n\nSadly, Mia is the only person who truly cares for Philia. Because of Philia's expressionless face and aloof demeanor, their parents always scold her, and the citizens complain about her. Moreover, Julius Girtonia, the second prince and Philia's fiancé, would rather have a more amicable girl as his wife-to-be. For that reason, he cancels the engagement and sells Philia off to the neighboring kingdom, Parnacorta, which has recently lost its own saint.\n\nHaving no say on the matter, Philia immediately goes to serve Parnacorta. As a foreigner, she presumes that she will not be treated much better than in Girtonia.

But through relentless perseverance, she overcame her limits and found liberation in the very thing that once seemed impossible: running. While the other horse girls at Kasamatsu chase victory and fame, Oguri runs without ambition, driven only by the joy of movement.\n\nFujimasa March, a rising regional star, commands attention with her discipline, talent, and tenacity. For her, running is a matter of pride. But when a school-organized race brings her face-to-face with Oguri's raw, unpolished stride, March's confidence begins to waver.

Across multiple villages, all the victims have one thing in common: they had entered the so-called Werewolves' Forest right before they developed strange deformities and subsequently died. The rumors put blame on a \"witch's curse,\" the nearby villagers' firm belief based on old folklore.\n\nUnconvinced that anything truly supernatural is at play, Ciel and his contracted demonic butler, Sebastian Michaelis—along with the rest of the Phantomhive servants—come across an isolated village in the Werewolves' Forest. Its residents are only women, hostile toward the outsiders and serving a young girl with emerald eyes and bound feet, Sieglinde \"Green Witch\" Sullivan. Ciel and Sebastian investigate to uncover the truth, but as they soon fall victim to the curse themselves, it appears that there is more to the local myths than meets the eye.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, a talking frog suddenly speaks to her, sees in her the potential to become a witch, and transports her to the Witch-Verse. There, the frog introduces Yuina to four other girls he has recruited—the cheerful Choco Mitsumata; the composed Kyouka Kitahara; the easygoing Mai Kamiizumi; and the short-fused Azu Niisato who is apprehensive of Yuina's arrival.\n\nDespite the initial clash of personalities, the five girls aim to become true witches. To achieve that goal, they must grant people's wishes in the real world through music—the most efficient conduit for channeling magic.
