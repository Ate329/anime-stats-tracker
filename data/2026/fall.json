However, she has turned them all down due to her secret heart defect. Despite her condition, Satoko is still willing to find a husband to ease her beloved father's concerns.\n\nWhile on a stroll, Satoko is kidnapped by a group of mercenaries, one of them being Shinpei Gotou—a legendary assassin tasked with executing her.

Out of options, Satoko makes a desperate gamble: under the pretense of love at first sight, she asks him to marry her.\n\nUnexpectedly, Gotou takes the bait and vows to protect her. As the couple escapes to freedom, Satoko struggles to keep up the ruse and make sense of the mysterious man she has eloped with.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unable to give up hope, her parents desperately search for a cure in even the most obscure places, leading to the appearance of a hooded man claiming he can help rid Nia of her condition. But rather than curing her, the hooded man transplants the soul of a deceased hero who was undefeated in battle into the girl's frail body.\n\nGiven a second chance at life as Nia, the hero is determined to recover her new body's strength by using a technique known as chi to target and eliminate the illness at its roots. With her enthusiastic hunger for combat having also been carried over, Nia is eager to return to exploring the world. However, the hero's restless soul yearns to find a worthy opponent who can defeat her on the battlefield, sparking chaos wherever Nia may go.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
