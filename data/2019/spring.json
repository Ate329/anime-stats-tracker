    "synopsis": "Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the family has fallen upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.\n\nWhen he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Even after the outer gate is plugged, they strangely encounter no opposition. The mission progresses smoothly until Armin Arlert, highly suspicious of the enemy's absence, discovers distressing signs of a potential scheme against them. \n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2 follows Eren as he vows to take back everything that was once his.

Their peaceful break will not last for long, however, as enemies old and new gather their strength and prepare for another face-off.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Preferring a quiet life however, he secludes himself deep in the rural woods, dedicating his time to raising an orphan that he saved.

As the years pass, Shin displays unparalleled talent in both magic casting and martial arts, much to Merlin's constant amazement.\n\nOn his 15th birthday, however, it becomes apparent that Shin only developed his combat skills and nothing else, leaving him with blatant social awkwardness, a lack of common sense, and a middling sense of responsibility. As a result, Shin enrolls in the kingdom's Magic Academy to hone his skills and mature among other teenagers. However, living a normal life is impossible, as he is established as a local celebrity almost as soon as he arrives.\n\nAs Shin Wolford adjusts to his high school life in the capital, he makes new friends, learns about the world, and fights off the various forces of evil surrounding him and his city.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "\"Once upon a time, fairies were tools of war.\"\n\nThe story takes place in a world where fairies possess and dwell in animals, giving them mysterious abilities. By removing the organs of a possessed animal and transplanting them into humans, fairies can be summoned as an alter ego and be used as a weapon. Such individuals who used fairies as war tools were called \"Fairy Soldiers.\" Once the war was over and they completed their roles, the soldiers lost their purpose. Some began working for the government, some joined the mafia, and some even became terrorists, as each chose their own way to live.\n\nNine years have passed since the war. The protagonist Mariya is a new recruit of \"Dorothea,\" an organization which investigates and suppresses fairy-related crimes. Amidst the unstable political situation, criminals with lingering wounds from the war and past conflicts emerge and engage in terrorism as an act of revenge. This is the story of Fairy Soldiers, fighting for their own justice in a chaotic postwar world.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

These zombies plague the world, and are the creations of the Otters and manifestations of people's deepest desires. With no other choice, Keppi must rely on three young boys: Kazuki Yasaka, who must carry a box with him wherever he goes; Enta Jinnai, Kazuki's childhood friend; and Tooi Kuji, a delinquent and a school truant.\n\nBy having the mythical organ called a shirikodama removed from them, the boys are able to become Kappa themselves and fight the Kapa-zombies. However, to defeat them, the boys must connect with each other via their minds, bodies, and—most importantly—secrets. As the Kappa Kingdom relies on these boys, they must reveal themselves as they have never done before, all the while learning that connections are fragile and truly precious things.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Arata's surprises do not end there, as later that night, he meets a legendary creature called a Tengu that refers to him as the famous Heian-era exorcist, Abe no Seimei. Unfamiliar with the exorcist, Arata pays no mind and continues to work with his team, utilizing his unique ability to assist in the resolution of their cases. \n\nMistaken by many occult creatures as Abe no Seimei and quickly becoming notorious for his special ability during his work, Arata becomes curious of his origins and invests himself more into solving cases regarding occult creatures he encounters once he learns of a certain connection between himself and the exorcist. However, Arata will quickly find that dealing with supernatural creatures is not as simple as he thought, as danger begins to play a fundamental role in his everyday findings and his ability starts to present an unexpected issue.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Ever since they encountered aliens on the moon, humanity's technology has developed by leaps and bounds. Half a century later, even though most have it easy, Robby Yaji and Hacchi Kita cannot seem to catch a break in this advanced society. Robby—a man perpetually struck by misfortune—owes large sums of money to debt collectors due to his poor investments in shady get-rich-quick schemes, and Hacchi finds it difficult to get over the boredom of his mundane life.\n\nThe two end up on an adventure of a lifetime when loan shark boss Yang sends Hacchi to collect the money Robby owes. Rather than pay up, Robby blasts off into space and heads to Isekandar, a planet that supposedly brings happiness to anyone who visits. Seeing a chance for some much needed excitement, Hacchi tags along with Robby on this journey filled with alien encounters, giant robot battles, and all sorts of troublemaking—all the while avoiding Yang and his cronies who are desperately combing the universe to find them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The Bakumatsu was an era in which the souls of young men burned with anxiety for their country's future. Takasugi Shinsaku, a soldier of fortune from Choshu, sneaks aboard a government ship with his comrade Katsura Kogorou in search of a mysterious \"timepiece\" with the power to manipulate time that he fears the government wishes to keep for themselves. Rather than allow such power to fall into the wrong hands, Takasugi plans to destroy the artifact, but having obtained it, the artifact is quickly stolen, forcing the pair to follow the mysterious thief to the seat of government in Kyoto. However, when they arrive in the capital, they discover that the government has been overthrown and the deity Susanoo now reigns in its place. The streets of the city and the people in them are much different than Takasugi and Katsura remembered. The times may have changed but their mission hasn't - Takasugi and Katsura resolve to reset time and save their nation from the nefarious forces trying to hijack it.\n\n(Source: Tokyo Otaku Mode)",
