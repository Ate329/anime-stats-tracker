    "synopsis": "After undergoing Benimaru Shinmon's hellish training, Shinra Kusakabe and Arthur Boyle return to Special Fire Force Company 8. However, there is no time to rest: Captain Akitaru Oubi is arrested by the military police under the influence of the White-Clad cult. Moreover, the White-Clad member Haumea—one of the eight pillars who possess Adolla Burst—has successfully brainwashed the leadership of the Tokyo Empire and infiltrated the heart of the firefighting organization. As a result, Shinra and the rest of the Company 8 squad are branded as rebels after they launch a rescue mission to save their captain and ultimately liberate Tokyo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In the year 2048, Dr. Deniz Skinner, a scientific genius dubbed second only to Einstein, developed the revolutionary painkiller Hapna. Being cheap with no reported side effects, the drug gained widespread acceptance, even though Skinner himself silently vanished one year after launching the drug. Everyone revelled in the heaven of relief and ecstasy provided by Hapna, but they would suddenly come crashing down to Earth. It is now 2052, and Skinner reappears, giving the shocking announcement that Hapna was designed to mutate into a lethal toxin, killing anyone who had consumed it. While he claims to have a cure, he will only hand it over if he is physically found within 30 days. \n\nAxel Gilberto, a maverick youngster serving a sentence of 888 years in a high-security prison, is unwillingly recruited by a group calling themselves Lazarus. Composed of eccentric misfits, the group has only one task—to find Skinner. With no means to escape and their lives on the line, Lazarus begins the hunt to find Skinner before the countdown to the end of humanity ends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now starting to learn how to fight alongside his classmates and slowly growing out of his solitary past, Sakura has become the grade captain of the first-years.\n\nSakura's skills are put to the test when he and his classmates are faced with KEEL—a delinquent group known for its ruthless violence and coercion. While KEEL seems to be another rowdy group at first glance, their sudden appearance and strength in numbers might just be hiding a greater evil behind it. With all the odds against the Bofurin members, Sakura must accept that recognizing his shortcomings and receiving help from his upperclassmen will be necessary to preserve the peace in Makochi.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In ancient times, some witches married their familiars, who had taken human form, giving birth to a lineage of ogres. One such ogre is Morihito Otogi, who while appearing completely human, still retains the inhuman strength of his bloodline. Nico Wakatsuki is a young witch and Morihito's childhood friend, but as part of her education, she had to go to the Witches' Holy Land to train and part ways with Morihito.\n\nYears later, just before Morihito's first year of high school, Nico returns home with one goal in mind: to claim him as her familiar. While most witches choose a cat or a bat, Nico has her heart set on Morihito in more ways than one. Although seemingly oblivious to her true feelings, Morihito and Nico end up living together under the same roof with both of Morihito's parents elsewhere. While reluctant at first, Morihito accepts his new role, determined to help Nico seamlessly fit back in with human society and protect her from fated disaster. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Many have become astounding swordsmen themselves, but Beryl remains quite humble, referring to himself as an old man. His former disciples all disagree, including Allucia Citrus, a girl who graduated from Beryl's training over 10 years ago and is currently the commander of the Royal Order of Knights.\n\nWishing to reveal her cherished teacher's true greatness, Allucia recommends Beryl to her superiors, leading to his appointment as a special instructor for the Order by imperial command. She delivers the news herself—though Beryl has yet to realize her deeper motive. Pressured by his aging parents, Beryl reluctantly accepts the job and moves to the capital. There, he meets more of his past students, such as Surena Lysandra, now a black-rank adventurer, and Ficelle Harbeller, a prominent member of the Magic Corps. Before long, word begins to spread: not even the strongest warriors can match the \"old man\" from the countryside.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Amidst the walls of this fading yet beloved landscape lives Reiko Kujirai, a 32-year-old realtor deeply in love with her coworker, Hajime Kudou, who is two years her junior. Though they have their differences, the two get along well enough to experience the joys of the walled city together.\n\nHowever, everything starts to fall apart when Kudou, half-asleep, suddenly kisses Kujirai—seemingly reciprocating the feelings she has yet to confess. But when Kudou explains that he had mistaken her for someone else, Kujirai finds herself drawn into a series of events that lead her to a past she cannot remember.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Healers have always been a pivotal part of the Kingdom of Herzeth, but becoming one requires an official license, which demands years of studying. Despite growing up poor, a pragmatic young man, Zenos, taught himself everything about healing. As an exceptional healer, Zenos was even recruited by an adventurer party but eventually kicked out. When he meets and helps an elf slave named Lily, he realizes his new ambition: he wants to open a clinic in the shadows, serving those who may otherwise be cast aside.\n\nZenos starts his underground practice alongside Lily, but he is immediately pulled into a conflict between lizardmen, werewolves, and orcs—which he quickly resolves and unites the races, thanks to his healing abilities. However, when the royal knights hear rumors of his recent accomplishments and are less than pleased, Zenos must find a way to continue his operations without compromising his principles.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At that point, she would have never even thought of reaching level 99 through only killing slimes, let alone becoming the strongest being in the continent.

With her ever-growing circle of companions, Azusa's laid-back adventures are far from over—and with even more girls appearing on her doorstep, her already enjoyable life is slated to become even livelier!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Even stranger, the imperfect score suddenly becomes a perfect 100% right before his eyes. Wanting to make sure what happened was not just a hallucination, he confronts her about it.\n\nSeemingly unbothered, Takamine reveals to him that she has an ability called Eternal Virgin Road, which allows her to undo any mistake she makes by taking off a piece of underwear, thus keeping up her prodigious facade. With Shirota being the only one aware of the truth, Takamine coerces him into becoming her closet—a carrier of spare panties—so that she can use Eternal Virgin Road as many times as she wants. With his already weak will being constantly put to the test, Shirota's life is flipped upside down as he finds himself too close for comfort with the unpredictable student council president. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The settlement was ruled by its shrine maiden, Itsukihime, whom only a select few were allowed to interact with. When Itsukihime passed away, Shirayuki was appointed in her place. Wishing to stay in contact with her, Jinta worked diligently for years and was finally selected as the next sentinel.\n\nAs the protector of the village, Jinta's duty is to eliminate any threats. One day, he encounters a demon in a nearby forest. At the end of the battle, the demon makes a proclamation about the destined ruler of all demonkind. He attaches his severed arm to Jinta, turning him into an unaging demon man. By the time Jinta comes to, Kadono is on fire. Suzune has transformed into the demon from the divination, and due to a series of misunderstandings, she murders Shirayuki and flees.\n\nDevastated, Jinta cannot forgive Suzune for her actions; he departs on a journey to find her. As Jinta travels around Japan across the eras, he endeavors to protect as many people as possible from aggressive demons. In his quiet moments, he contemplates what he should do when he once again faces his childhood friend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He is perfectly satisfied as the party's helper—until the other members kick him out and replace him with a stronger ally. Left without a way to provide for himself, Kurt begins searching for a job.\n\nWith his job prospects limited by his lack of combat ability, Kurt gladly accepts any work that comes his way. During one such job, he meets Yulishia, an adventurer formerly employed by the royal family. Surprised by Kurt's impressive work, Yulishia discovers that he is no ordinary boy: Kurt possesses an astonishingly high aptitude in a variety of non-combat fields. Due to these talents, a court official tells Yulishia to offer Kurt a high status in the kingdom that would allow him to live in peace for the rest of his life.\n\nWhen Yulishia informs Kurt about his potential rank, he brushes off the offer, refusing to think of himself as above other people. Still unaware of his real power, Kurt continues taking as many odd jobs as possible, which might just make him a pivotal part of the kingdom before he even notices it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Two sisters form the newest generation of holy women who protect the lands from monsters and calamities. The eldest, Philia, is considered a prodigy in the field, capable of solving any problem in no time. Meanwhile, the youngest, Mia, is not as extraordinary as her older sister but has charmed the entire country with her lovely personality. Despite their striking differences, Philia and Mia share an unbreakable bond.\n\nSadly, Mia is the only person who truly cares for Philia. Because of Philia's expressionless face and aloof demeanor, their parents always scold her, and the citizens complain about her. Moreover, Julius Girtonia, the second prince and Philia's fiancé, would rather have a more amicable girl as his wife-to-be. For that reason, he cancels the engagement and sells Philia off to the neighboring kingdom, Parnacorta, which has recently lost its own saint.\n\nHaving no say on the matter, Philia immediately goes to serve Parnacorta. As a foreigner, she presumes that she will not be treated much better than in Girtonia. Contrary to her expectations, Philia might have finally found a place with people worth smiling for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Jou Kitahara, a rookie trainer with big dreams and modest expectations, does not expect to find talent in the quiet town of Kasamatsu—until he meets an ash-gray-haired girl with a wild, unconventional stride.\n\nAs a child with bad knees, Oguri Cap spent much of her early life in pain, struggling to stand. But through relentless perseverance, she overcame her limits and found liberation in the very thing that once seemed impossible: running. While the other horse girls at Kasamatsu chase victory and fame, Oguri runs without ambition, driven only by the joy of movement.\n\nFujimasa March, a rising regional star, commands attention with her discipline, talent, and tenacity. For her, running is a matter of pride. But when a school-organized race brings her face-to-face with Oguri's raw, unpolished stride, March's confidence begins to waver. In turn, something in Oguri shifts after racing March. For the first time, a spark of ambition ignites within her—a desire to win that will take her beyond the confines of her hometown to the grand stages waiting on the horizon.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The rumors put blame on a \"witch's curse,\" the nearby villagers' firm belief based on old folklore.\n\nUnconvinced that anything truly supernatural is at play, Ciel and his contracted demonic butler, Sebastian Michaelis—along with the rest of the Phantomhive servants—come across an isolated village in the Werewolves' Forest. Its residents are only women, hostile toward the outsiders and serving a young girl with emerald eyes and bound feet, Sieglinde \"Green Witch\" Sullivan. Ciel and Sebastian investigate to uncover the truth, but as they soon fall victim to the curse themselves, it appears that there is more to the local myths than meets the eye.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Still, Yachiyo continues to fulfill her duties, just as she promised the hotel's owner before his departure.

During one skirmish, infamous Zeon pilot Char Aznable successfully infiltrated an enemy base and stole a prototype mobile suit called the Gundam. With this powerful weapon, Char helped his allies achieve a decisive victory. However, in a freak accident involving the Gundam's advanced technology, Char vanishes alongside his signature red mobile suit.\n\nSix years later, pockets of war continue to rage on. Teenager Amate \"Machu\" Yuzuriha lives on a quiet space colony with her mother. Though her classmates attend taxing cram schools, Machu yearns for a more exciting life. Her wishes are answered through the crash landing of the Gundam QuuuuuuX, a state-of-the-art mobile suit used by a squad of Zeon soldiers. Machu discovers a natural affinity with the suit, and she uses it to fend off Federation forces. She is aided in her efforts by the mysterious Shuuji Itou, who pilots a Gundam that bears a remarkable resemblance to the one once used by the missing Char.\n\nUnbeknownst to Machu, her brawl is witnessed by a group of mecha enthusiasts who use mobile suits to fight in duos for competitive sport. In the pursuit of a thrilling life and human connection, Machu partners with Shuuji and engages in a series of escalating clan battles as hints of a greater conflict loom above her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, when he witnesses a fire tied to a past case and Osanai herself, Kobato cannot help but slip back into his old, less-than-ordinary habits in search of the truth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Out of nowhere, a man approaches Reiko and introduces himself as Kageyama, her newly assigned butler. As soon as Reiko confides in him about her worries, he criticizes her lack of deduction skills and helps her quickly crack the case.

Those Gears eventually stand against humanity in a rebellion. Although they manage to overcome in the struggle for survival known as the Crusades, humanity's losses are so great that even after several decades pass, their emotional wounds remain unable to fully heal.\n\nSin Kiske, the child of a human and a Gear, heads to his father Ky and mother Dizzy's wedding ceremony. Their wedding breaks the ultimate taboo: a union between a human and a Gear. Even with the world at peace, it took many years for such a ceremony to come to fruition. Despite the complex array of emotions surrounding it, the wedding ceremony is met with blessings. When suddenly, a mysterious girl appears... The fated child inheriting Gear blood–and the mysterious girl who despises Gears. Their meeting would shake the world.\n\n(Source: Official site)",

When Kanna learns that one of her classmates has been cursed to death by a ghost, she decides to investigate the school building at night, only to find that the supposed ghost was actually Akihiko.

One day, a talking frog suddenly speaks to her, sees in her the potential to become a witch, and transports her to the Witch-Verse. There, the frog introduces Yuina to four other girls he has recruited—the cheerful Choco Mitsumata; the composed Kyouka Kitahara; the easygoing Mai Kamiizumi; and the short-fused Azu Niisato who is apprehensive of Yuina's arrival.\n\nDespite the initial clash of personalities, the five girls aim to become true witches. To achieve that goal, they must grant people's wishes in the real world through music—the most efficient conduit for channeling magic. As Yuina learns to control her newfound powers, her journey into a magical life helping others will be far more vibrant than any photo her camera can ever hope to capture.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
