It is years later, and while the older brother Yuru has become a hunter of animals, his sister Asa has been locked away in a cage, ordered to perform a special duty that prohibits her from meeting more than a few select individuals.\n\nOn an otherwise inconspicuous day, a group of armed men riding in helicopters, referred to as \"dragons\" by the citizens, assaults the village in search of Yuru, killing every adult on sight. When Yuru attempts to meet up with Asa and flee, he finds a dead body instead—on top of that, the person who killed her claims to be Yuru's true twin sister.\n\nBefore the woman can capture him, Yuru is rescued by a man named Dera, an outsider who frequently visits the village. However, it is not long before the two are cornered. In a last-ditch effort, Dera makes Yuru give a gift to the deity of the village, summoning a pair of daemons whose existence is bound to reveal the truth behind these chaotic events.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But just as she prepares to claim her meal, things take a very unexpected turn.\n\nInstead of devouring him, Kanan ends up forming a \"romantic contract\" with Youji. For someone who's lived for millennia without experiencing love, navigating high school romance proves more terrifying than any hunt. Between awkward dates, hand-holding mishaps, and feelings she can't quite name, the once-proud demon finds herself flustered at every turn.\n\nA supernatural romcom about a lovestruck demon and the boy who was supposed to be her prey—sweet, chaotic, and full of firsts.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

    "synopsis": "This omnibus adolescent drama is about a group of young girls who all attend a \"girls-only musical school,\" recounting the formative years they shared, at times shifting between different characters' viewpoints and time.\n\nAwajima Musical School Training Camp, dubbed the \"boarding house,\" is where young girls gather from all over Japan to perform on stage. Tabata Wakana aspires to be a musical star; housemaster Takehara Kinue attends to carry on her best friend's wishes; beautiful Okabe Emi is a scholarship student who is always at the center of attention; and Ibuki Katsurako, who became a teacher at the school though originally from a family of actresses.\n\nThe unique environment of the musical school is simultaneously a respite space for these aspiring girls and also a harsh battleground that pits young students against each other. It is a place where perseverance can lead to blossoming talents, but also to a cruel reality at times. The clear depiction and psychological portrayal allow the subtle inner workings of each character to come through.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival, edited)",
