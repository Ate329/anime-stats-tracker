    "synopsis": "Fate/strange Fake centers around an imperfect copy of a Grail War based on the Third Holy Grail War in Fuyuki. Following the conclusion of the third Grail War, a US-based organization with magi distinct from the London-based Mage Association, used data from Fuyuki's Grail War to plan their own ritual. Seventy years later, they used the city of Snowfield as the Sacred Land for their own Grail War. However, they were unable to successfully replicate every aspect of the ritual, resulting in it acting only as an imitation that has lost the Saber class and allowed for the summoning of strange Servants due to the blurring of the definition of a \"hero.\"\n\nRohngall and his pupil, Faldeus, have been dispatched by the Mage's Association to investigate the city and the state of the war. Faldeus, a US organization spy, has Rohngall sniped upon his arrival, despite knowing that Rohngall is a puppet. He declares that their Holy Grail War has been in development and is real, causing a commotion at the Clock Tower, and that he wishes to \"advertise\" the project to the Association.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

Yet, beneath these simple exchanges, feelings of love are quietly blossoming.\n\nSuzuki sees Tani for who he is: a straightforward boy who respects everyone equally, completely unconcerned about fitting in. Unlike Tani, she is too hung up on what everyone else thinks, desperate to keep her crush a secret. However, a slight misunderstanding leads to Suzuki confessing her feelings—and to her delight, Tani feels the same. Jittery with excitement, the young couple starts dating, embarking on a wonderful journey of friendship and love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She believes it is merely a coincidence—until she comes face to face with the real celebrity! Her surprise only grows when she discovers that, unlike the extroverted superstar known to the public, Tamon is actually a gloomy guy with no friends or self-confidence.\n\nGiven that Utage's adoration for Tamon knows no bounds, she vows to keep his secret and stay by his side—but dealing with Tamon's contrasting behaviors in and out of work might be the toughest job out there.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But when he compliments her, Yoi feels flustered, and the way he looks at her gets her all nervous. He is the first boy to acknowledge her as a girl, and her attempts to distance herself prove futile as he seems to have set his sights on her. While Yoi keeps telling herself that it is nothing serious, even she cannot completely ignore the stir Kohaku causes in her heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "It is common knowledge that nobles will do anything for power; lying, manipulation, and extortion are the usual tactics. However, one family is exempt from this generalization: House Grail, whose main tenets are truth and integrity. The youngest daughter, Constance Grail, is just as moral as the rest of her family, believing in always doing the right thing and helping those in need.\n\nHowever, these ideals do not help her when her fiancé cheats on her with another woman. Framed by his lover in the hope of her downfall, Constance has no one to hear her pleas for justice. Everyone turns a blind eye, save for one—the spirit of the infamous Scarlet Castiel—who possesses Constance and turns the tables on her accuser. However, this aid does not come without a price.\n\nTen years ago, Scarlet was executed for the attempted murder of Princess Cecilia. But this was actually a setup; as blunt and harsh as Scarlet could be, she would never stoop so low as to use poison. She has no idea who orchestrated her incrimination, but Scarlet demands that Constance—as the only one who can see her—help her exact revenge on all those who wronged her!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Amid his efforts to save her, the two are transported to another world. He soon learns that the people in this world summoned a saint to save their kingdom from a plague. As compensation for dragging Kondou into the mess, the kingdom assures him that they will provide him with a comfortable life and fulfill any of his desires. To everyone's surprise, Kondou asks for a job.\n\nAfter successfully becoming an accountant at the Royal Palace, Kondou devotes himself to his new post. His accurate and thorough work catches the attention of various high-ranking officials and knights, especially Aresh Indolark, the cold-hearted Knight Captain. As Kondou adjusts to his new exhausting and dangerous environment, he begins to find solace in the company of Aresh, whose icy demeanor may be just a facade.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "After seeing Izumi Sano at a high jump competition, Mizuki Ashiya became completely enamored by him—even moving from the United States to Japan and enrolling in the same institute as him. However, Sano's academy is an all-boys school!\n\nDue to her bright personality, Mizuki quickly befriends her class without drawing suspension to her gender. To her surprise, she ends up being not only Sano's classmate but also his roommate. Though she is now able to admire Sano in close proximity, she learns that Sano has quit high jumping and refuses to pick up the sport ever again for unknown reasons. Moreover, the academy's doctor, Hokuto Umeda, might be onto Mizuki's facade. Now, Mizuki has to find a way to reignite Sano's passion—all without revealing her secret.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With skin that is poisonous to the touch and a breath that will kill if close enough, she is forced to stay secluded from nearby civilization. Even with these conditions, Luna still visits a nearby city to deliver medicine and buy new books to read.\n\nDespite Luna having never done harm to any of the city’s residents, many are scared to associate with her, as she is a black witch in a kingdom ruled by white witches. Only able to watch from a distance while people receive her medicine and freely converse with one another, Luna is drawn toward their lives, even if it sometimes means putting herself in danger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Consequently, Ahriman had to halt his invasion of the world in the worry that his daughter's behavior is not one befitting someone of her kind. She loves making friends, helping others, and bringing happiness to all creatures including their enemies, the humans.\n\nAhriman, however, congratulates Dou for her good deeds instead of scolding her. With the help of his aide Jahy, who is assigned as Dou's master, the two try to get rid of her kindhearted nature—so that the Demon King's daughter goes from a cute, adorable, and nice little girl to an inhuman, cruel, and twisted little demon.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having been accused of being one and blamed for her childhood friend's death, Sooha enrolls in Decelis Academy—a night school where supernatural beings, such as vampires and werewolves, allegedly cannot enter.\n\nAt the academy, Sooha soon encounters Heli, a student who offers friendship despite discovering her secret. Heli introduces Sooha to his close friends—Jaan, Jino, Shion, Jakah, Noa, and Solon—who all have different powers as well. But their connection seems to run deeper than just that; they are curiously drawn to her, feeling as if they would do anything she wishes.\n\nIn light of a recent murder that is said to be the work of a vampire, Heli and his friends' unsettling history slowly unravels. While the seven boys try to shield Sooha from the world of the supernatural, she inevitably gets entangled in the centuries-old rivalry between vampires and werewolves. As tensions intensify, Sooha realizes that she may be closer than ever to the creatures she hates the most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The only ones who can take them down are Heroes, bounty hunters who boost their own ether powers using the drug E3 (E-Three). With legalized killing as part of the job, being a Hero is less about justice and more about survival.\n\nYashiro, known as the Reaper, is one such Hero—an independent enforcer who works alone. That is, until Jougamine, a high school girl and self-proclaimed \"apprentice,\" forces her way into his life. Reluctantly taking her under his wing, Yashiro soon finds himself caught in a whirlwind of deadly conflicts.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

There's a mermaid, a werewolf, a rabbit, and a bird...all of whom are now my charges. It's my duty to teach them about humankind—and maybe in the process, I'll learn a few things myself. This isn't an alternate world or a case of reincarnation. It's just the story of a teacher at a somewhat peculiar school, and his students who are striving to become human.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

While on the way there, he receives an ominous text message from Todoroki telling him to turn back and that once someone enters Gunma, they never return.\n\nIgnoring the message, As Kamitsuki goes about his school life and makes new friends. These people make it their mission to prove any negative stereotypes surrounding Gunma wrong and show Kamitsuki all the ways Gunma is different from the rest of Japan—from its local foods and landmarks, the changes to its daily school life, and even the attitude of the people who live there. Gunma is widely regarded as the least popular prefecture in Japan, but they clearly don't know Gunma yet!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
