    "synopsis": "Despite occasional setbacks, Operation Strix has remained on track to extract sensitive information from the enigmatic politician Donovan Desmond. To this end, spy Loid Forger has managed to maintain his pretend family consisting of his telepathic daughter, Anya; assassin wife, Yor; and their clairvoyant dog, Bond. Still the only one aware of everyone's true identities, Anya tries to sustain the family's cohesion while working to befriend Donovan's son Damian, her Eden Academy classmate.\n\nHowever, Anya's efforts instead earn her another Tonitrus Bolt, bringing her closer to getting expelled and jeopardizing the operation's success. Hearing the news, Loid faints from shock. In his unconsciousness, he reminisces about his tragic past and his journey to becoming a spy. Realizing what Operation Strix means to him and the world, Loid finds renewed motivation. Although they each work toward their own covert goals, the Forgers continue to cherish their chaotic yet blissful family life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, to preserve her family's image, she suppresses her instincts and tolerates the abuse inflicted by her childish fiancé, Second Prince Kyle Von Pallistan. Only Kyle's brother, First Prince Julius, is aware that there is more to Scarlet than meets the eye, but she cares little about his growing interest.\n\nIn the middle of a ball, Kyle accuses Scarlet of harassing Terenezza Hopkins, a commoner that has taken his heart. Scarlet's engagement to Kyle is nullified, leaving her outraged that all of her efforts to endure thus far have amounted to nothing. Scarlet dons her studded leather gloves, once again becoming the \"Mad Dog Princess.\" Joined by Julius and werebeast Nanaka, Scarlet is ready to give filthy nobles a taste of their own medicine—one punch at a time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But digging into royal secrets is a dangerous game, and when Akira uncovers an evil scheme, he also makes a powerful enemy—the very king who brought him to this world! With the help of the elven spirit medium Amelia, can he find the power to set things right, and get his revenge?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

During his journey throughout different lands, he has even befriended the mythical wolf Fel and a slime named Sui. While enjoying a meal one day, the trio is interrupted by a tiny but rare pixie dragon who also wants a bite of their food. Like Fel and Sui, the dragon immediately falls in love with Mukouda's cooking and decides to become the man's familiar, receiving the name Dora-chan.\n\nHowever, cooking is not Mukouda's only forte. His familiars' incredible strength constantly attracts the attention of guilds who ask for their help on different quests. In exchange, the guilds are able to process the game Mukouda and his familiars hunt, enabling their growing party to sample various kinds of monster meat.

For the adults, Santa Claus is a very real menace that needs to be neutralized by the Saint Nick Pursuit Unit in case he makes an appearance.\n\nShiori Fuyumura, a student of Daikoku Welfare Academy, is determined to find her best friend, Ichie Ono, who has been declared dead after being missing for six months. One morning, Fuyumura summons her fellow class representative, Kazushige Sanda, only to attack the unknowing boy. She is convinced that Sanda is the descendant of the infamous Santa Claus—the only person who can make her wish of finding Ono come true—and is determined to force out his dormant true self by any means necessary.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As the son of the legendary Sword Princess Fara and Archmage Leon—two of the highest-ranked individuals in their respective classes—Arel seemed destined for greatness. Unfortunately, he is branded as classless and thus unable to naturally inherit any kind of specific skill.\n\nHowever, Arel soon discovers that he can replicate the abilities of any class he desires—though doing so demands significantly more effort than it does for the naturally gifted. Eager to test his unprecedented skills even more by finding stronger opponents, Arel sets out to defy the limits imposed upon him and prove that perseverance can surpass even divinely appointed talent.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Everything changes one summer when she meets a mysterious girl with eyes as deep and clear as the sea, drawing Hinako in like nothing else has in a long time.\n\nDuring her absent-minded search for the girl, Hinako is suddenly pulled underwater by a beastly deep-sea creature, only to awaken to the presence of the girl—Shiori Oumi—who takes on a monstrous form and kills Hinako's attacker. Despite this heroic act, Shiori's intentions are no different from any other monster's: she wants to eat Hinako.\n\nThe following morning, Shiori walks into Hinako's class as a transfer student, and Hinako cannot help but smile—at last, someone who could fulfill her quiet wish for death has appeared before her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Saku Chitose appears to lead an enviable high school life. Extraordinarily charismatic, tremendously confident, and effortlessly friendly, he is the kind of person others naturally look up to. But his popularity carries its own burdens; not everyone views him kindly, and whispers of cynicism follow wherever he shines too brightly. To Saku, living an ugly life is worse than death—a belief that drives his need to maintain his perfect reputation.\n\nAt the start of his second year, Saku's homeroom teacher asks him to help bring back a classmate who has stopped attending school. Initially hoping to resolve the matter quickly, Saku finds out that the shut-in Kenta Yamazaki harbors open contempt for him and everything he represents. A simple favor instead exposes the distance between those who live within the social light and those who were never given a chance to shine.\n\nSurrounded by the expectant gazes of those who both admire and despise him, Saku treads the delicate line between sincerity and performance—searching for what it truly means to live beautifully in a world that sees only the surface.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Yet, unbeknownst to them, a socially awkward woman hides underneath the facade, simply struggling with casual communication and masking it with a strong attitude. However, her mask begins to crack when a promising rookie, Yuu Kamegawa, joins the team and Azusa gets assigned as his mentor.\n\nDetermined to guide Kamegawa just like how her senior once trained her, Kannawa puts utmost effort into showing him the ropes. But as they grow closer, she slowly lowers her guard, gradually revealing that the seemingly rigid department ace might actually be far kinder than anyone initially thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, her unique tastes and intimate knowledge of monsters have led to her social isolation: few nobles interact with her willingly, disdainfully calling her the \"Voracious Villainess.\"\n\nWhen a monster attack erupts at a royal banquet—where Melphiera has been sent to find a husband—Aristide Rogier du Galbraith, the younger brother of the crown prince, leaps to her aid. Due to his terrifying skill in slaying monsters, Aristide has earned the title of \"Blood-Man Duke.\" Charmed by Melphiera's fearlessness and intriguing culinary prowess, Aristide  soon declares his intent to propose.\n\nTogether, Melphiera and Aristide, high society's most eccentric couple, strive to see beyond the cruel rumors and encourage each other's fascination with monsters and the art of preparing them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She has the power to transform her surroundings by manipulating the elements of the periodic table. On top of that, Ellen also has a great amount of scientific knowledge due to being a scientist in her past life.\n\nDuring the war against a neighboring kingdom, Rovel Vankreift, the hero of the Kingdom of Tenbahl and eldest son of house Vankreift—as well as Ellen's father—was fatally injured. However, the spirit who fought by Rovel's side, Lady Origin, brought him to her realm to save him from the clutches of death. Lady Origin, who happens to be the Queen of the Spirit Realm as well as Ellen's eventual mother, is one of the most powerful spirits in existence, making little Ellen quite powerful in contrast to her innocent looks.\n\nBut even a family as happy as this one has its fair share of problems, as Ellen and her parents are forced to reconnect their old ties to the Vankreift household in order to defend their relatives' honor—all while hiding Ellen's dangerous existence from the public to preserve their undisturbed happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He is soon captivated by his classmate Kashiwada, a mysterious student who consistently wears a blank face. Oota conspires to break her placid demeanor through scares and mischievous schemes, though his tactics always seem to backfire.\n\nOota is known as the class clown and is constantly disciplined by his teacher, who claims \"his face gives it away.\" To no fault of his own, he lacks control of his emotions and facial expressions. Kashiwada, on the other hand, seems perpetually emotionless and unreadable—no one knows what she is thinking!\n\nOota and Kashiwada are complete opposites, but that does not stop a unique relationship from developing between them. As they realize their feelings for each other, it raises an important question: do opposites really attract?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having avoided the first couple of death flags, Satou's suddenly left in the dark when a mysterious stranger returns from the Lily Kingdom-a character she doesn't recall writing in the original script. Although Yomi claims to be her ally, can Satou really trust a character she knows nothing about in such a dangerous world?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

Among the four other crew members is a Gnosia: a Gnos infectee whose goal is the eradication of humanity. The Gnosia appears human in all other respects, so the uninfected have little choice but to vote on whom they suspect to be the enemy, hoping to neutralize the Gnosia by putting them into cold sleep. If the Gnosia survives the vote, they will eliminate one crew member during the cruiser's following warp, when only the Gnosia remains conscious.\n\nVoting quickly proves to be an unreliable strategy, and Yuuri is left one-on-one with the Gnosia. Just when all hope seems lost, time seemingly loops back to when Yuuri first awakened. With each time loop, however, conditions aboard the ship change—neither the size of the crew nor the members' identities remain constant. Trapped in both time and space, Yuuri must figure out how to escape the loops and save humanity from the Gnosia.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Fighting alongside King Ying Zheng of Qin—who seeks to unify China and end the chaos—Xin leads his own unit, the Fei Xin Force, onto the battlefield.\n\nWith power reclaimed from the influential Chancellor Buwei Lü, King Ying Zheng begins laying the groundwork for a new, unified legal state with the support of key allies like strategist Changping Jun and legalist Li Si.\n\nAs Qin launches a campaign to seize new territory from the state of Zhao, their advance is halted by the brilliant strategist, Li Mu. In response, Changping Jun devises a bold plan: to bypass Zhao's defenses and strike at the key city of Gyou, near Zhao's capital.\n\nTo carry out this risky maneuver, a powerful coalition army is formed—led by the tacticians Ou Sen (Wang Jian), Kan Ki (Huan Yi), and the warrior queen Yo Tan Wa (Yang Duanhe). Joining them are the next generation of Qin commanders: Xin's Fei Xin Force, Mou Ten (Meng Tian)'s Gaku Ka Unit, and Ou Hon (Wang Ben)'s Gyoku Hou Unit, each operating independently.\n\nThe fierce battle for Gyou begins, as the future of Qin's unification hangs in the balance.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

    "synopsis": "Alma, an autonomous self-learning robot with advanced combat capabilities, was created by two genius scientists, Enji Kamisato and Suzume Yobane, who developed Alma's artificial intelligence and robotics, respectively. After being mocked by their former acquaintances, the duo have worked together in order to show the world their true talents. But even though they cooperate in their work, the two scientists cannot seem to get along in their personal lives.\n\nHowever, despite their constant bickering, Enji and Suzume develop a glint of mutual affection—feelings that do not go unnoticed by their adorable robotic creation. Now curious, Alma starts to question the true nature of her creators' relationship. As she learns more about humanity from those around her, Alma's bonds with Enji and Suzume only grow stronger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
