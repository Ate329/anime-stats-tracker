Unfortunately, he fails right away when he takes the seat beside the school's  madonna—Shouko Komi. His peers now recognize him as someone to eliminate for a chance to sit next to the most beautiful girl in class.\n\nGorgeous and graceful with long, dark hair, Komi is universally adored and immensely popular despite her mysterious persona. However, unbeknownst to everyone, she has crippling anxiety and a communication disorder which prevents her from wholeheartedly socializing with her classmates.\n\nWhen left alone in the classroom, a chain of events forces Komi to interact with Tadano through writing on the blackboard, as if in a one-way conversation. Being the first person to realize she cannot communicate properly, Tadano picks up the chalk and begins to write as well. He eventually discovers that Komi's goal is to make one hundred friends during her time in high school. To this end, he decides to lend her a helping hand, thus also becoming her first-ever friend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When a chance encounter with a shadow creature should have left him traumatized, it instead makes him believe that he has found a friend amidst those who only choose to notice his shortcomings. He starts meeting with Kage, the shadow, regularly, to the point where even the otherwise abrasive creature begins to warm up to him.\n\nKage and Bojji's unlikely friendship lays the budding foundations of the prince's journey, one where he intends to conquer his fears and insecurities. Despite the constant ridicule he faces, Bojji resolves to fulfill his desire of becoming the best king he can be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, despite his loyalty, that very same organization takes action to silence him, ultimately leading to his demise. Drowning in frustration and regrets he can no longer suppress, he finds himself in an audience with a goddess attracted by his exceptional skills. The goddess offers him reincarnation into a magnificent world of swords and magic so he can perform a crucial mission: prevent that world's destruction by slaying its hero.\n\nAccepting the goddess' request, he is reborn as Lugh Tuatha Dé, the son of a noble family of assassins serving the Alvan Kingdom. Under the guidance of his father, Lugh learns new assassination techniques that significantly differ from the cold-blooded and unsympathetic killing style of his previous life. Furthermore, his other talents bloom, allowing him to meet new allies and acquaintances. Even so, Lugh knows that his efforts are far from adequate, because a monumental adversary such as the hero can only be defeated with perfection.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Humanity's only form of defense against the D2s are Musicarts, young women representing pieces of classical music; and Conductors, the ones controlling them.\n\nTakt Asahina, an aloof piano prodigy, finds himself transformed into a Conductor following a spontaneous D2 attack. The same incident kills Anna Schneider's younger sister, Cosette, and brings Takt into contact with his Musicart, Destiny. Searching for a means of stabilizing the pact between themselves, Takt and Destiny—alongside Anna—embark on a perilous journey to the Symphonica Headquarters in New York City.\n\nTakt is in a hurry to reach the city so that he can play the piano again, even though his passion attracts the creatures he has come to despise. Meanwhile, Destiny's sense of duty drags the group into trouble along the way.

Yatora spends his days working hard to maintain his academic standing while hanging out with his equally unambitious friends. However, beneath his carefree demeanor, Yatora does not enjoy either activity and wishes he could find something more fulfilling.\n\nWhile mulling over his predicament, Yatora finds himself staring at a vibrant landscape of Shibuya. Unable to express how he feels about the unusually breathtaking sight, he picks up a paintbrush, hoping his thoughts will be conveyed on canvas. After receiving praise for his work, the joy he feels sends him on a journey to enter the extremely competitive Tokyo University of the Arts—a school that only accepts one in every two hundred applicants.\n\nFacing talented peers, a lack of understanding of the fine arts, and struggles to obtain his parents’ approval, Yatora is confronted by much adversity. In the hopes of securing one of the five prestigious spots in his program of choice, Yatora must show that his inexperience does not define him. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As his anguish steadily chips away at his will to live, he is eventually pushed to the brink. Prepared to throw it all away, he stands on the edge of a precipice and takes the leap. However, instead of falling to his death, he enters a trance where he meets a winged being who claims to be his guardian angel. Named Nasse, the angel offers him two priceless abilities and convinces him to go on living.\n\nWhen Mirai experiences the marvel of his new powers firsthand, he gets a taste of the freedom that was locked away from him for so long. Armed with Nasse's gifts, Mirai is flung into a showdown with 12 other individuals, one of which will be chosen to become the next God. In stark contrast to when he wanted to end his life, Mirai is now prepared to do whatever it takes to protect his bleak chance at happiness, lest it be wrenched from his grasp forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Since then, the space race between the confederacy and its competitor, the United Kingdom of Arnack, has intensified; the two countries hope to one day send humans to the cosmos above.\n\nAs a dog's biology is inherently different from a human's anatomy, there is no way to perfectly identify the risks involving space travel and its effects on an individual's body without actually sending someone for observation. However, Zirnitra's government has a potential solution: to experiment on vampires, whose biological similarity to humans is too significant to ignore.\n\nDespite being forcibly taken from her home in the mountains, vampire Irina Luminesk shows no resistance and is even willing to train as a test subject. Lev Leps, a former top candidate to become the first human cosmonaut, is designated to accompany Irina and act as her guide. Through their time together, Irina and Lev begin to develop a mutual love for outer space, bringing them closer together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Deemed incapable by his father and other wealthy relatives, he has been forced into exile; he experiences idle days of reading and sleepless nights of irrepressible angst. True to the Shimas' famous pride and determined not to disgrace his family, Tamahiko is resigned to his new duty—stay in the mountains and wait for death to put an end to his suffering.\n\nHowever, on one snowy night, Tamahiko's insomnia is interrupted by someone knocking at the door. He then meets the 14-year-old Yuzuki Tachibana, who announces that she has come to be his future wife! Suddenly, Tamahiko remembers his father promising to send him a bride to assist him with impediments to his daily life.\n\nAlthough she was sold as a bride to repay her family's debts, Yuzuki proves to be thoughtful, diligent, and dedicated to Tamahiko. Will the world-weary teenager prove insensitive to the rare breeze of kindness her presence brings to his monotonous existence?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From castles to forests, the \"Restaurant to Another World\"—as its patrons call it—travels far and wide. \n\nNekoya's diverse and bizarre clientele can expect to be greeted by one of two devoted waitresses—the courteous demon waitress Aletta, or the enigmatic and elven Kuro. As customers, both old and new, pile into the establishment with stories of their respective lands, Master and his staff ensure that everyone is in for a scrumptious adventure of a lifetime.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The \"Labyrinth\" is an expansive space deep underground where humans live in clusters known as \"colonies.\" Over the years, the surface has become a distant memory—even perhaps only a fantasy to those who have never experienced its wonders.\n\nMaking sure humanity survives the harsh conditions of the underground, a colony's citizens can take on a variety of specialized jobs. These include \"Workers,\" who mine precious ore to fuel the colonies, and \"Markers,\" who journey into the Labyrinth's surprisingly lush environment to bring back information that eases navigation. However, humanity also faces a threat to its existence—creatures called \"kaijuu\" whose sizes range from that of a small child to an enormous building, and are hostile to any human they see. Moreover, kaijuu that are large enough can force their way into the colonies, further increasing their threat level.\n\nMemenpu is a nine-year-old college graduate whose inventions have greatly benefitted the Workers in her local colony. Recently, however, she has been dreaming of a place with a neverending ceiling not bound by bedrock. These aspirations fuel her desire to become a Marker and explore the Labyrinth's vast unknown in search of such a fantastical place. Despite her father Gagumber's vehement disagreement, a certain incident with the kaijuu jumpstarts a dangerous yet exciting adventure that will surely alter humanity's course forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Teruto soon encounters another player, Sakura Banka, who helps him remember both how to play Build Divide and his original mission: that no matter what, he must meet the King. Teaming up together, Teruto and Sakura find that their best chance for a royal audience is with the Rebuild tournament, where the one who collects twenty-one tokens from other competitors can challenge the King for their throne. However, as Teruto continues to play, he begins to regain his lost memories that call into question the very nature of Neo Kyoto.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Due to a weak heart, Suzune Miyama has remained bedridden for most of her childhood. However, despite her illness, she has always dreamed of becoming an idol. Eventually, her opportunity comes in the form of the seventh Selection Project—a brutal series of competitions best known as the starting point of the legendary idol Akari Amasawa.\n\nAnxious but excited, Suzune enters the preliminary round of Selection Project. Though her singing dazzles the judges and her fellow competitors, Suzune is unfortunately overcome by her nerves and freezes up in the middle of her performance. She recovers quickly, but the stumble is great enough that she loses the winning spot and is disqualified.\n\nOr so it seems—until Seira Kurusu, the girl Suzune lost to, announces that she plans to drop out of Selection Project, believing Suzune is a more talented singer and therefore deserves the right to compete. Suzune is caught off guard by the decision, but promises Seira that they will meet again as top idols. She prepares herself for the challenging obstacles that lie ahead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Amid this chaos, a high school student named Takeru Shirogane suddenly wakes up from a terrifying nightmare where he sees mankind in utter defeat. Soon after, he realizes that his dream was nothing more than the recollections of his life in an alternative universe. In those memories, the Alternative V project is implemented, sending hundreds of thousands of people into space as a last resort to preserve humanity, while leaving the remaining billion on Earth to suffer a cruel fate.\n\nYearning to change this grim future, Takeru joins a military base in Yokohama, which happens to be his former high school. There, he manages to convince the base's vice-commander and leader of the Alternative IV project, Professor Yuuko Kouzuki, to prevent Alternative V from happening. To ensure the success of Alternative IV, Takeru must pilot the gigantic humanoid machines Tactical Surface Fighters (TSF) alongside his fellow cadets. However, he has only two months to complete his training and exploit his partial knowledge of the future—lest the ensuing tragedy take place.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Vampires have existed for centuries and live under the rule of the Scarlet Moon. Once a year, \"Visual Prison\" occurs, a visual kei competition where the vampire who sings the most beautiful song is bestowed with great power by the Scarlet Moon. At the forefront of the competition are ECLIPSE—the reigning champions who stand for an established order, and LOST EDEN—a group that believes the strongest should rule.\n\nAnge Yuki is a lonely boy with no confidence in his singing ability. He moves to Harajuku in search of a musician he idolizes, but during his quest, he gets entangled in one of the many live performance clashes between ECLIPSE and LOST EDEN. Their fascinating stages stun him, but he soon collapses, overcome by bloodlust. Regaining consciousness, Ange finds himself under the care of Guiltia \"Guil\" Brion, the musician he admires, and learns that he is a dhampir—half-human, half-vampire.\n\nWhile Ange now has the privilege of participating in the upcoming Visual Prison, Guil explains that he will not join him in this endeavor. Meanwhile, Ange encounters Robin Laffite, a foreigner from England who is enamored by his astonishing singing voice. With the day of the competition slowly creeping up, Ange has to put together a capable unit in an exciting race against time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

According to the rumors, several people have fallen victim to these specters. Those fortunate to survive their encounters with the paranormal beings claim that they resembled glitched holograms.\n\nHazakura Academy middle school student Hiro Amanokawa believes these sightings are merely an urban legend. However, as the incidents start to increase in frequency, he is reminded of the day his father suddenly vanished, with strange digital watches serving as the only relics of his disappearance. Much like the other sightings, what happened to Hiro's father cannot be explained by conventional logic. \n\nOne day, when a fellow student in the academy is attacked by a Hologram Ghost, Hiro and his friend Kiyoshirou Higashimitarai decide to look into the matter. Little does Hiro know that this investigation will be their first step toward discovering a dangerous world previously unknown to mankind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The earth has already been destroyed...\n\n99.9% of the human race has been wiped out by a mysterious alien force from outer space. The enemy is named \"Dracters.\" Eventually, a large hole was drilled in the earth and terraformed into a suitable environment for the aliens to live. Humans have no choice but to hide in shelters to escape their eyes. Waiting for the day of resurrection, which they do not know when it will come...\n\nThe inhabitants of the shelter Ixia have had their memories of the day of destruction erased, and live a normal life without knowing anything about it. However, some of them, the \"chosen ones,\" have become pilots, driving giant robots called \"Rogue\" and fighting against aliens. Today, another new pilot is selected...\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll, edited)",
