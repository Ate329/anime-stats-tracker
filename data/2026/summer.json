In an orphanage that raises children as soldiers, death is nothing new to the residents. With their home country embroiled in a war that has dragged on for too many years and shows no signs of stopping, the institution's children are sent off to die in battle every day. In contrast to the other orphans, Sheena is deeply disturbed by the ongoing conflict and wishes for it to end.\n\nOn the night of her roommate's death, Sheena met a blood-covered girl who remained jubilant despite the condition she was in. The next day, the girl appears as a new student in Sheena's class and introduces herself as Mimi Kagari. Initially thought to be a school myth, Mimi is said to be the secret weapon of the orphanage—a girl who cannot die. Assigned as Sheena's new roommate, Mimi hopes to get along with her and get accustomed to school life.\n\nHowever, unsettled by Mimi's carefree attitude toward the war, Sheena struggles to accept the world they live in, all while their unusual friendship flourishes amid the bleak situation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to great improvements in cybernetics, its citizens are able to replace their limbs with robotic parts. The world is now more interconnected than ever before, and the city's Public Security Section 9 is responsible for combating corruption, terrorism, and other dangerous threats following this shift toward globalization.\n\nThe strong-willed Major Motoko Kusanagi of Section 9 spearheads a case involving a mysterious hacker known only as the \"Puppet Master,\" who leaves a trail of victims stripped of their memories. Like many in this futuristic world, the Puppet Master's body is almost entirely robotic, giving them incredible power.\n\nAs Motoko and her subordinates follow the enigmatic criminal's trail, other parties—including Section 6—start to get involved, forcing her to confront the extremely complicated nature of the case. Pondering about various philosophical questions, such as her own life's meaning, Motoko soon realizes that the one who will provide these answers is none other than the Puppet Master themself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The sole thing that gets the middle-aged Sasaki through his soul-sucking job is a cheerful smile from Yamada—the young woman who works at a nearby 24-hour supermarket he frequents. After every tiring day of getting berated by his boss, Sasaki stops by the store to have his spirit healed by his favorite cashier.\n\nAfter a particularly grueling day, Sasaki shows up at the supermarket, only to find that Yamada's shift has already ended. Disappointed, he searches for a place to smoke when a woman from behind the store calls him over to join her. The bold and dangerously playful Tayama is quick to call out Sasaki's peculiar habit of always seeking out her coworker—even going as far as telling Yamada about Sasaki's vested interest in her.\n\nNow, in addition to seeing his adored cashier Yamada, Sasaki also visits the store to see if his new smoking partner Tayama is around. But there is more to Tayama's mischievousness than she initially lets on. With every cigarette, an unlikely friendship begins to blossom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Seventeen-year-old Jirou Azuma lives a quiet life with his grandfather, utilizing his supernatural ability to speak with animals to befriend and protect them. Both Jirou and his grandfather are descendants of a long-standing shinobi clan, training in combat to keep the art of battle alive within their family. Jirou's life is thrown into upheaval after rescuing a seemingly normal black cat, Ragou, only to discover that the cat is actually a mononoke—a demonic spirit that has long been at war with mankind. When a hostile mononoke comes looking for Ragou, Jirou uses his shinobi training to jump to the cat's defense, but immediately suffers a mortal wound.\n\nFaced with the decision of whether or not to devour Jirou's fading energy and restore himself to full power, Ragou instead chooses to give his remaining energy to Jirou. Reviving the boy, the transfer also grants him great supernatural powers that complement his own shinobi fighting style. This act is witnessed by Ryousuke Shiba, an officer in the Bureau of Espionage whose job revolves around dispatching aggressive mononoke. Shiba extends Jirou and his grandfather an offer: to join the Bureau's new squad, Black Torch, and help them battle powerful mononoke who seek to devour innocent people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although human safety is barely being maintained, the world remains on the brink of collapse. As the threat of death and destruction lingers, people go about their daily lives by turning away from the constant danger around them. In response, the United Nations establishes EXCEEDS, an organization tasked with investigating and combating threats caused by the Invasion Species.\n\nThe story begins in the Far Eastern island nation of Mizuho, where Shiina Kuze, a young hunter who exterminates invasive species, lives on a remote island. Wanting nothing more than a quiet life with her only family—her younger sister, Setsuna—Shiina's routine is disrupted when an unexpected incident occurs, drawing her into a much larger conflict.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

But there was something Kakeru didn't know at first—she can't see. Unlike Kakeru, Koharu hasn't given up on anything, even with her blindness. She attends university daily, shows interest in clubs, makes friends—and dreams of launching fireworks one day. Kakeru wonders why, when she can't see them...but maybe it doesn't matter. And maybe he can start moving forward, too, for the girl who's always been by his side.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

When she learns that her long-admired, yet long-inactive, favorite manga artist Hoshi no Rei will be exhibiting at COMITIA, she sets off on a journey to Tokyo.\n\nWhat she doesn't expect, however, is that a fateful encounter at the event will change her life forever.\n\n\"How does one become a manga artist?\" Ai steps into the world of manga creation—a path she thought she understood, yet knows so little about. This is the story of a girl taking her first steps down the road to becoming a mangaka.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

However, due to family reasons, Hinako has to play the role of the \"perfect young lady\" at school. Wanting to protect her, Itsuki takes care of her in a very caring manner. Eventually, Hinako begins to fawn on Itsuki with all her might...\n\n\"Now... if Itsuki isn't around, I would hate it.\"\n\nThis is a love story that begins with a cute young lady with a gap that transcends the master-servant relationship.\n\n(Source: Hobby Japan, translated)",
