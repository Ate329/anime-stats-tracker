Through the \"Authority of Gluttony,\" Rem was put into suspended animation, while Crusch's memories and even Julius’s name were devoured. As he searches for a way to save them, Subaru learns of the \"wise man\" Shaula—an all-seeing being said to possess every form of knowledge. His next destination is the Pleiades Watchtower, home to a wise man, the farthest tower standing in the vast, uncharted desert known as the Auguria Dunes—a place so perilous that even the mightiest \"Sword Saint,\" Reinhard, failed to conquer it. The fury of nature, unknown magical beasts, and unimaginable dangers lie ahead. Together with his friends, Subaru embarks on a life-risking journey to reclaim what was lost.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa)",

Following the conclusion of the third Grail War, a US-based organization with magi distinct from the London-based Mage Association, used data from Fuyuki's Grail War to plan their own ritual. Seventy years later, they used the city of Snowfield as the Sacred Land for their own Grail War. However, they were unable to successfully replicate every aspect of the ritual, resulting in it acting only as an imitation that has lost the Saber class and allowed for the summoning of strange Servants due to the blurring of the definition of a \"hero.\"\n\nRohngall and his pupil, Faldeus, have been dispatched by the Mage's Association to investigate the city and the state of the war. Faldeus, a US organization spy, has Rohngall sniped upon his arrival, despite knowing that Rohngall is a puppet. He declares that their Holy Grail War has been in development and is real, causing a commotion at the Clock Tower, and that he wishes to \"advertise\" the project to the Association.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

    "synopsis": "Coco, a humble dressmaker's daughter, has always been fascinated by magic and the witches who cast it, despite the strict precautions they take to hide their methods from the public. However, when Coco takes advantage of a golden chance to spy on the skilled witch Qifrey, she realizes that her favorite picture book was a disguised magic book all along! In her excitement, she immediately starts testing out the various spells.\n\nWhen a spell causes a disaster in her home, Qifrey rescues her just in time and decides to train her, realizing that she is the first lead he has found that could help him track down the Brimmed Caps—a dangerous group of heretics who experiment with forbidden body-altering magic and spread magical artifacts among the commoners. But before Coco and Qifrey can confront the Brimmed Caps, she is going to have to improve her magical skills and learn to get along with Qifrey's other apprentices. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Next to Miyu Suzuki, a trendy and bubbly high school girl, sits Yuusuke Tani, a quiet and frank boy. Their interactions are brief, limited to Suzuki's unprompted random questions and Tani's succinct answers. Yet, beneath these simple exchanges, feelings of love are quietly blossoming.\n\nSuzuki sees Tani for who he is: a straightforward boy who respects everyone equally, completely unconcerned about fitting in. Unlike Tani, she is too hung up on what everyone else thinks, desperate to keep her crush a secret. However, a slight misunderstanding leads to Suzuki confessing her feelings—and to her delight, Tani feels the same. Jittery with excitement, the young couple starts dating, embarking on a wonderful journey of friendship and love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to great improvements in cybernetics, its citizens are able to replace their limbs with robotic parts. The world is now more interconnected than ever before, and the city's Public Security Section 9 is responsible for combating corruption, terrorism, and other dangerous threats following this shift toward globalization.\n\nThe strong-willed Major Motoko Kusanagi of Section 9 spearheads a case involving a mysterious hacker known only as the \"Puppet Master,\" who leaves a trail of victims stripped of their memories. Like many in this futuristic world, the Puppet Master's body is almost entirely robotic, giving them incredible power.\n\nAs Motoko and her subordinates follow the enigmatic criminal's trail, other parties—including Section 6—start to get involved, forcing her to confront the extremely complicated nature of the case. Pondering about various philosophical questions, such as her own life's meaning, Motoko soon realizes that the one who will provide these answers is none other than the Puppet Master themself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She has been dubbed the school's \"prince\" by virtue of her boyishly attractive appearance and casual disposition. However, she chooses to be indifferent toward the attention she receives and spends her days normally—that is, until the school's other prince, Kohaku Ichimura, waltzes into her life and calls her beautiful.\n\nKohaku is nothing like a prince—he acts thoughtlessly and does as he pleases. But when he compliments her, Yoi feels flustered, and the way he looks at her gets her all nervous. He is the first boy to acknowledge her as a girl, and her attempts to distance herself prove futile as he seems to have set his sights on her. While Yoi keeps telling herself that it is nothing serious, even she cannot completely ignore the stir Kohaku causes in her heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "It is common knowledge that nobles will do anything for power; lying, manipulation, and extortion are the usual tactics. However, one family is exempt from this generalization: House Grail, whose main tenets are truth and integrity. The youngest daughter, Constance Grail, is just as moral as the rest of her family, believing in always doing the right thing and helping those in need.\n\nHowever, these ideals do not help her when her fiancé cheats on her with another woman. Framed by his lover in the hope of her downfall, Constance's pleas for justice are ignored. Everyone turns a blind eye, save for one—the spirit of the infamous Scarlet Castiel—who possesses Constance and turns the tables on her accuser. However, this aid doesn't come without a price.\n\nTen years ago, Scarlet was executed for the attempted murder of Princess Cecilia. But this was actually a setup; as blunt and harsh as Scarlet could be, she would never stoop so low as to use poison. She has no idea who orchestrated her incrimination, but Scarlet demands that Constance—as the only one who can see her—help her exact revenge on all those who wronged her!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Sano's academy is an all-boys school!\n\nDue to her bright personality, Mizuki quickly befriends her class without drawing suspension to her gender. To her surprise, she ends up being not only Sano's classmate but also his roommate. Though she is now able to admire Sano in close proximity, she learns that Sano has quit high jumping and refuses to pick up the sport ever again for unknown reasons. Moreover, the academy's doctor, Hokuto Umeda, might be onto Mizuki's facade. Now, Mizuki has to find a way to reignite Sano's passion—all without revealing her secret.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After every tiring day of getting berated by his boss, Sasaki stops by the store to have his spirit healed by his favorite cashier.\n\nAfter a particularly grueling day, Sasaki shows up at the supermarket, only to find that Yamada's shift has already ended. Disappointed, he searches for a place to smoke when a woman from behind the store calls him over to join her. The bold and dangerously playful Tayama is quick to call out Sasaki's peculiar habit of always seeking out her coworker—even going as far as telling Yamada about Sasaki's vested interest in her.\n\nNow, in addition to seeing his adored cashier Yamada, Sasaki also visits the store to see if his new smoking partner Tayama is around. But there is more to Tayama's mischievousness than she initially lets on. With every cigarette, an unlikely friendship begins to blossom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Already at his wit's end, 29-year-old corporate slave Seiichirou Kondou suddenly witnesses the ground opening up and swallowing a woman. Amid his efforts to save her, the two are transported to another world. He soon learns that the people in this world summoned a saint to save their kingdom from a plague. As compensation for dragging Kondou into the mess, the kingdom assures him that they will provide him with a comfortable life and fulfill any of his desires. To everyone's surprise, Kondou asks for a job.\n\nAfter successfully becoming an accountant at the Royal Palace, Kondou devotes himself to his new post. His accurate and thorough work catches the attention of various high-ranking officials and knights, especially Aresh Indolark, the cold-hearted Knight Captain. As Kondou adjusts to his new exhausting and dangerous environment, he begins to find solace in the company of Aresh, whose icy demeanor may be just a facade.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Ever since she was a young girl, Sooha was told to hide her superhuman abilities to avoid getting mistaken for a vampire. Having been accused of being one and blamed for her childhood friend's death, Sooha enrolls in Decelis Academy—a night school where supernatural beings, such as vampires and werewolves, allegedly cannot enter.\n\nAt the academy, Sooha soon encounters Heli, a student who offers friendship despite discovering her secret. Heli introduces Sooha to his close friends—Jaan, Jino, Shion, Jakah, Noa, and Solon—who all have different powers as well. But their connection seems to run deeper than just that; they are curiously drawn to her, feeling as if they would do anything she wishes.\n\nIn light of a recent murder that is said to be the work of a vampire, Heli and his friends' unsettling history slowly unravels. While the seven boys try to shield Sooha from the world of the supernatural, she inevitably gets entangled in the centuries-old rivalry between vampires and werewolves. As tensions intensify, Sooha realizes that she may be closer than ever to the creatures she hates the most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ever since she could remember, Akane Ousaki has been mesmerized by her father Tooru's rakugo performances. Peeking in behind a sliding door, she would spend hours watching and mimicking his work.\n\nFor Tooru, the only thing separating him from that coveted rank is a promotion test in front of an audience and a senior rakugo master, Issho Arakawa. Despite his passionate performance, Tooru finds himself expelled from the rakugo school following the exam. This makes him give up on rakugo entirely and settle for a regular job, breaking his daughter's heart.\n\nFilled with grief and anger, Akane now seeks vengeance on the man who refuses to see the genius behind her father's rakugo style. She begs Tooru's former rakugo master, Shiguma Arakawa, to take her under his wing. But Shiguma feels unworthy of taking on another pupil after what happened to her father six years prior. In order to see if she has what it takes to enter the rakugo world, Shiguma urges Akane to test her resolve by performing in front of an audience.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Within the Kingdom of Ei's opulent inner court is the thriving Maiden Court, where the empress and the four imperial consorts are chosen from five prominent clans. Among them, one pristine consort-in-training, Reirin Kou, stands out as the perfect candidate for the future empress. Her virtue and elegance are unrivaled, and she is flawless—save for her extremely sickly constitution. Compared to the court's gentle butterfly, the boorish Keigetsu Shu is like a sewer rat. Always staring at Reirin with bitter envy, Keigetsu is a disgrace to the Maiden Court.\n\nDuring the night of a rare comet sighting, Keigetsu's jealousy reaches its peak, and she attempts to murder Reirin by pushing her off a balcony. Reirin is quickly saved from death, and Keigetsu is imprisoned to await her execution. Unbeknownst to all, Keigetsu has cast a spell to swap bodies with Reirin in order to steal all that belongs to her. But while Keigetsu is hindered by Reirin's frail body, Reirin fully embraces freedom and physical strength for the first time in her life, determined to live—no matter whose face she wears.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Knowledge and skills come far too easily for him, to the point that nothing can captivate his interest. However, this changes the day he meets someone who never fails to betray his expectations—his fiancée and self-proclaimed villainess Bertia Evil Nochesse.\n\nBertia claims that this world is that of an \"otome game.\" She has been reborn as the villainess, and it is her duty to impede the relationship between Cecil and the heroine. Never one to shy away from fate, she zealously takes to her evil role... to mixed results. Though she doesn't realize it, Bertia's supposedly \"evil deeds\" always come off as sincere and kind. Finally relieved of his melancholy, there is never a boring day for Cecil as he observes his unknowingly good-hearted fiancée.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With legalized killing as part of the job, being a Hero is less about justice and more about survival.\n\nYashiro, known as the Reaper, is one such Hero—an independent enforcer who works alone. That is, until Jougamine, a high school girl and self-proclaimed \"apprentice,\" forces her way into his life. Reluctantly taking her under his wing, Yashiro soon finds himself caught in a whirlwind of deadly conflicts.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

Consequently, Ahriman had to halt his invasion of the world in the worry that his daughter's behavior is not one befitting someone of her kind. She loves making friends, helping others, and bringing happiness to all creatures including their enemies, the humans.\n\nAhriman, however, congratulates Dou for her good deeds instead of scolding her. With the help of his aide Jahy, who is assigned as Dou's master, the two try to get rid of her kindhearted nature—so that the Demon King's daughter goes from a cute, adorable, and nice little girl to an inhuman, cruel, and twisted little demon.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Furthermore, his body has regressed in age to the point where he looks like a mere teenager.\n\nFollowing his triumph, Luck soon reunites with his friends, the hero Eric Imgard Mendirival and warrior Goran Morton. As they believed Luck to be dead, the pair made sure he went down in history as a hero and prepared to quell the rise of the demons themselves, unaware of Luck's feat. With all this in mind, Luck just wants a laid-back life, so he applies as a novice adventurer under the name Lock and sets out on a journey alongside brand new companions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She seizes fortresses from local lords to build her forces, negotiates with the church for healing, secures funds from merchants, and has her soldiers gain experience through monster hunting.

The surviving humans now live away from the big cities, still hoping to reclaim them one day. An entirely new generation, unaware of the pre-Red Day world, is coming into its own.\n\nThe story begins when Aki, who has no memories of the world before its fall, escapes her village with her close friends Haru and Natsuki to search for her missing father. As they venture into the outside world, they find themselves surrounded by zombies on all sides! Along the way, they rescue Yuu and Sakura and take refuge in a home improvement store. They regroup, and now the counterattack begins—!!\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, edited)",
