    "synopsis": "The name Tarou Sakamoto once instilled fear in every villain. No other professional hitman matched his prowess, and fellow assassins revered him. However, Sakamoto fell in love. In five short years, he married, became a father, put on some weight, and traded his weapons for an apron as he became the owner of a humble convenience store.\n\nAlthough Sakamoto is decidedly retired, he finds his old life of crime hard to shake off. His former partner, Shin Asakura, reappears and resolves to stay with Sakamoto's family under their strict no-kill rule. To make matters worse, a large bounty is placed on Sakamoto's head. Numerous assassins now pursue him—but they are in for a surprise. Sakamoto has not lost his edge, and no matter what tricks his enemies pull, he will fight off every last one to protect his dear family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Alina Clover becomes an adventurers' guild receptionist, believing that—unlike the adventurers who risk their lives every day to conquer dungeons—she will enjoy a safe and comfortable career with plenty of benefits. She hates overtime work more than anything, longing for the day when she can finally clock out on time. Sadly, that day has yet to come, as she must constantly trudge through piles upon piles of paperwork.\n\nTo make matters worse, when adventurers take too long to subjugate a dungeon boss, the backlog only grows, forcing Alina into even more overtime. Whenever her patience runs thin, she dons a disguise and takes care of the boss herself, soon gaining infamy as the enigmatic \"Executioner.\" Alina has managed to keep this secret for two years—until she finishes off a boss assigned to the high-ranking party Silver Sword. Unfortunately for her, the party's eagle-eyed leader, Jade Scrade, deduces her identity, jeopardizing the receptionist's dream of a carefree life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Mona's absolute confidence in her own charms, however, is shaken when she meets Medaka Kuroiwa, a recent transfer student to her highschool. Unlike all other classmates who constantly fawn over her, Medaka frowns every time they interact. Seeing his disinterest as something to be rectified, Mona pulls out all the stops in the hopes of winning Medaka over, only to be met with one stern face after another.\n\nTurns out, Medaka's indifference to Mona stems from his wish to one day become a monk, and hence must leave all worldly desires behind. As the unknowing Mona ramps up her attacks on Medaka, all her antics might lead her into falling for him instead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Although Kenzaburou Tondabayashi is a 52-year-old bureaucrat, he is well versed in reincarnation stories where a protagonist suddenly awakens in a fantasy world. After being hit by a truck, Kenzaburou lands in that exact situation. However, what baffles him is the fact he wound up in the world of an otome game—as the young villainess and the daughter of a duke, Grace Auvergne.\n\nFortunately for Kenzaburou, he is somewhat familiar with his new world, as it is based on the game called Magical Academy: Love &amp; Beast. He was a proud father in his previous life, and he often listened to his daughter rave about the game's setting and characters. Armed with background knowledge and a lifetime's worth of dad skills, Kenzaburou strives to make the most of his new life, though his kind-hearted nature makes it difficult to fully embrace the role of a villainess.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The tiny department, consisting of Takao and her sole resident Yuu \"Kotori\" Takanashi, treats complex cases that most other departments within the hospital cannot resolve on their own.\n\nThe mystery-obsessed Takao always tries to insert herself into cases that capture her fancy—much to the dismay of her colleagues and the police. Even if her meddling creates more problems for the hospital and those around her, none can deny the brilliance that the young department head exhibits as she weaves a diagnosis together. No matter the specialty, no case is impossible for Takao and a somewhat reluctant Takanashi to solve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Yet the master of time, Mephisto Pheles, gives Rin a key that transports him 40 years into the past when his late mother, Yuri Frederick Egin, was merely a child. With Mephisto's guidance, Rin leaps through the years of Yuri's childhood and her adolescence as an exorcist-in-training.\n\nEarly on, Yuri meets Shirou Fujimoto, Rin and Yukio's adoptive father. As Rin follows Yuri and Shirou's lives, he witnesses firsthand the initial appearances of Satan, his true father, and the horrors unfolding at the True Cross Order's special Section 13. Yuri's unique connection to Satan eventually leads Rin to the truth behind the most horrific event in exorcist history and the day he and Yukio were born—the Blue Night.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Tsukasa Akeuraji always dreamed of becoming a competitive solo figure skater, but starting too late in life meant his ambitions never got off the ground. Now barely scraping by, he takes on an assistant coach job, resigned to a future far from the one he once imagined.\n\nBefore his first day, Tsukasa meets Inori Yuitsuka, a shy fifth grader sneaking into the rink to practice. Captivated by figure skating, but held back by her mother's overprotectiveness and her own self-doubt, Inori has never been encouraged to pursue her passion until she encounters Tsukasa. Beneath her personality lies great potential, waiting to be unlocked with the right guidance.\n\nMoved by Inori's determination to change and reminded of his own struggles, Tsukasa offers to coach and help her chase the dream she has been too afraid to voice. While the road ahead is long and filled with unfamiliar challenges and rival skaters, Inori dedicates herself to the art and strives to one day reach the Olympics and become a medalist. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In a twist of fate, however, he finds himself in the lowest parts of a dungeon, ironically reincarnated as a Behemoth, an S-class monster of unparalleled strength and one of the very creatures he had once sworn to protect humans from.\n\nBeginning as a juvenile, he deceptively resembles an ordinary orange cat. Despite his seemingly overpowered ability to absorb the skills of any creature he devours, his escape from the dungeon leaves him gravely wounded. Just in time, Aria, a D-rank adventurer, stumbles upon him, decides to nurse him back to health, and ultimately takes him in as her pet, naming him Tama.\n\nAcknowledging Aria as his master and with his knight's honor from his past life on the line, Tama vows to defend her from danger at all costs—even if it means squandering this second chance at life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As the two spend more time together, Tsukasa grows to appreciate Shizuri's company—and his feelings just might be mutual.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After watching a child her age perform on television with mesmerizing grace, Hana decides to try it herself. She practices by reciting tales to Tonaki Island's children, who are always enthusiastic about her performances. However, growing up in such a small community, Hana remains unaware of the possibilities beyond her world, satisfied with how things are.\n\nEntering Sumomogaoka High School as a first-year student, Hana catches the attention of Mizuki Usurai, the president of the broadcasting club, with her skills. Despite Hana's hesitation and anxiety about the road ahead, Mizuki successfully convinces her to join the club, nurture her gift, and perhaps one day reach the top—the nationals of the NHK Broadcasting Competition.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Avid gacha player Minami Aoba finds herself at an impasse when her favorite game announces the end of its live service. Left adrift without her beloved characters, she realizes she has been wasting her first year of high school and sets out to try different clubs to find a new, more productive hobby. However, the harsh truth sets in that she is completely unfit for pretty much every sport her school's clubs have to offer.\n\nOne fateful afternoon, Minami stumbles upon a golf driving range after helping an old man carry his equipment there. Inside, she meets Haruka Akane, who promptly introduces her to the sport. Much like her previous attempts at athletics, Minami has no natural talent for golf, but something about the rhythm of swinging the club captivates her. Finally, Minami feels the spark of genuine excitement that she has been looking for—a new obsession within her reach.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
